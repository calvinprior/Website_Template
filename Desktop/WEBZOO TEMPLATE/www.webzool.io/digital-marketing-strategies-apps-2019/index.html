<p>Today, in 2019 we count mobile SEO marketing among the <a href="../digital-marketing-traditional-marketing/index.html">digital marketing </a>strategy. Enhance the demand for mobile devices influence all business sphere. A marketer must regularly update the digital marketing strategy to win the competition.  Innovation remains developing and we as a whole need to stay aware of the most recent patterns to ensure that we create an effective digital marketing strategy. Today, it is the ideal time to ponder what worked the previous period and how the most recent trends will influence our digital marketing strategy. Here are the fundamental trends you need to know and how to include them in your current digital marketing strategy. First and foremost, we want to underline primary trends in digital marketing strategy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Trends in digital marketing strategies for mobile apps</h2>
<p><img alt="marketing-strategy" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/WAzITdlTyMbouRKnlg96KvkVeHO95xn8xSbsL2W3iYiHP6X4XzhEbea02dl-0rmlI0ywsVfrYl7MHdaADDmAP36ZaYaWokOSQRiK_YQdjxxR8CJSahM3PoMIr1zLe8s1j9GBqA6K" style="height:418px; width:665px"></p>
<h3>Videos in digital marketing strategy</h3>
<p>Video contents will continue to rise. As increasingly social media channels put resources into videos, digital marketers are investing in the video to connect with their target group. On the other hand, we must consider setting goals in video marketing. Testing the better videos for our audience may take much time, but this analyses process is essential for mobile app marketing.</p>
<p>Today, social media channels prefer to use short videos, but the investigations may show us different result about our user groups. For instance, one of the most popular social platforms Instagram will put <a href="https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/06/20/welcome-to-igtv/index.html">resources on IGTV</a> in order to set this part as a new channel to use long video contents.  Maybe there is a chance to defeat the competition in advance. Because IGTV will be favored in a while.</p>
<p>Another new trend in digital marketing strategy is video advertisements. It can drive conversions and boost <a href="../brand-reputation-improvement-tactics-2019/index.html">brand awareness</a>. Some digital marketers state that video advertisements are the essential method in digital marketing strategy and the audience gets critical information about products or services before buying them. Digital marketers should optimize the video contents for marketing while the clarion call must be apparent and not hard. Creating alluring video contents is essential, and they must engage the audience to continue watching.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality in digital marketing strategy</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence changes mobile app marketing. The world has already tested it in personalization, customer experience, data analytics, etc. So, we highly recommend the usage of Artificial Intelligence in the new digital marketing strategy. Personalization is really vital than before, and clients are expecting an incredible shopping experience from brands.</p>
<p>It's fascinating that 73% of users want to give up information for an increasingly customized advertisement experience.</p>
<p>That's why experts suppose Artificial Intelligence as a connection between the client and the product. Furthermore, regarding investigations, Artificial Intelligence will increase to more than seven billion dollars per year by 2022.</p>
<p>Additionally, augmented reality has become an important position within the digital marketing strategy. Today many businesses understand that augmented reality may be helpful for app marketing and can boost messages of their brands. Different industries and different companies have already tested augmented reality in their marketing strategy, and customers are able to use it even more. Businesses can add augmented reality to the digital marketing strategy for several reasons. Here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increase customer experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell a story</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boost brand awareness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of gamification to promote the services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new method for reaching the audience and for creating engagement</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-a-virtual-world-of-exponential-change/index.html">GARTNER expects</a> that more than 100 million people will purchase with Augmented Reality in two years. That's why this period is a perfect chance to search how Augmented Reality works in our digital marketing strategy.</p>
<p><br>
 </p>
<h2>Data-driven digital marketing strategy</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p><img alt="data-driven-digital-marketing-strategy" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/2hCU64UpbF1mDsHM89Fl_B4YoWqYnRdS5nnAoVt5iIFx9jO0s0TszzGa_dlilak2SirfGTMAWXfADxlrK1kFCw2ODSdGUzS47CPaSE_rtXqAhZoS_OXneaAuIXsZNZxzStwI5T51" style="height:418px; width:665px"></p>
<p>Many successful marketing tactics depend on data to legitimize their approach. The more social platforms and channels we are testing, the higher the entrance to data analytics. These actions trigger the increase of collecting it all together with the addition of the relevant mobile apps. We can <a href="https://martechtoday.com/library/what-is-martech/index.html">benefit from Martech</a> in this competition to raise the reach of our digital marketing campaigns and clarify our strong influence sides.</p>
<p>A data-driven digital marketing strategy can assist us in getting more information about our customers to develop our campaigns and future methods. In other words, data-driven digital marketing strategy can provide us to increase the customer experience with the personalization. Alternatively, the usage of data-driven digital marketing strategy can even help us to make more productive campaigns to reach the target audience.</p>
<p>Social Media world is changing with stories. They are as of now sufficiently engaging to attract more digital marketers to test them, and we see that this process is going to be more critical in the following years.</p>
<p>Vertical content is all the more engaging in mobile app marketing, and Stories play a part in most <a href="../ultimate-guide-social-media-marketing-2019/index.html">social media platforms</a>, and Instagram is the most popular social media channel to post them.</p>
<p>Nowadays, approximately 400 million social media users use stories daily, and the statistics indicate that these users are more engaged to share stories than new posts on feeds.</p>
<p>But how the corporative users benefit from social media stories? What is the profit of stories for their digital marketing strategy? Corporative users or brands see the stories as verification of authenticity. They use many countdowns, video contents, giveaway contests, polls that are able to attract the audience. If we compare the structures, there is no fundamental difference between stories and news feeds. Therefore stories don't need creative professional support, but it doesn't mean that the current strategies are enough.</p>
<p>We mean that if you haven't added stories to your digital marketing strategy yet, so it is a moment to decide it. Create a new feature for your app and include it to the marketing strategy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Voice technology and the conversational content</h2>
<p><img alt="voice-technology" src="../../lh5.googleusercontent.com/ODTCaRpsiXO4rJ8VBX_niAI62DR2Nhl_-_smaXgVVFZpJXTkblCDCfRgTTQcAMWsSefkXTVdZKI0jgcrq4Btqmx2EUbbUGWYjqhTet6KVvN8_D9RgC-m1V3BnNd2RqMqDzl2ReJ0" style="height:418px; width:665px"></p>
<p>Voice technology sees an expanded reception rate day by day, and it will turn out to be considerably famous in the following years.</p>
<p>As our audience want to spend a lot of time on voice technology, we (digital marketers) must determine how to profit from the developing trend of mobile app marketing.</p>
<p>There are new types of promotion and conversational content that we have to add in our digital marketing strategy. After detecting that it is not the same with other promotional techniques, we should begin to investigate how to establish conversational content and how our marketing strategy will benefit from it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is not enough to find out marketing phrases and keywords. To profit from voice search is only possible with the knowledge of customers needs. Also, we must find out how our followers prefer to use a voice assistant.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.iab.com/events/?type=webinars/index.html">Interactive Advertising Bureau</a> (IAB), nearly 20% of USA users already possess mobile devices, and more than 60% of US citizens can't think their life without these gadgets. This usage of this marketing tendency can bring a significant chance for the brands that are prepared to invest in these trends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our mobile app might be in demand for business solutions, and it also may be a vital part of our whole digital marketing strategy that we need to get correct, accessible user data from and place it dynamic digital marketing analysis. It means to find an effective digital marketing strategy for mobile app marketing is crucial. We can't just count on the presumptions. We need to get and test the digital marketplace and apply useful marketing methods to get users to talk and use our mobile app. However, how do we find better ways?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Research of audience for digital marketing strategy</h2>
<p><img alt="research-of-audience" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/M2XFRQJczjNEGrhzl3pvKfliaWo_iODC2H5P0YXNZklgkhN6rd0SFJJLbHLbO4tJ1jXfEHoPHB613Xn5KIoORx_uXhVPD7two78yOwsVq9FeRErcaWLGL3XAYp8o2TqCLg_AD8c9" style="height:418px; width:665px"></p>
<p>We can launch all activity by determining our audience. We must have an assumption about our target group and who can benefit from using our app.  All these conditions are part of marketing. We must have real data about our audience and enhance our digital marketing strategy focusing on it.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we must learn about the demographic statistics of our potential users. Which data does the demographic statistics include? Users' behaviors, age, hobby, lifestyle, lovely things, and other elements may be a demographic statistics factor. These data help us to learn our potential customers. The primary rule of the mobile marketing app is that the product (application) is not for everybody. In other words, we can't expect that all people will be our members.</p>
<p>Even, it is impossible for Facebook. The interests differ from each other. However, the central principle of audience research is to find and attract more members. Experts say that more than 15% of startups fail because of the wrong investigation of audience research. However, we can't skip this stage in digital marketing strategy.</p>
<p>The digital era is ruthless, and the users are not patient and never give a second chance for apps. If they don't like a single element in our app, they will abandon us. So we might possess a unique mobile app interface, our service is identical but all processes terminate in users mind, and they decide everything.</p>
<p>In order to understand, to get user's want we have to research our audience correctly. It is an essential point in digital marketing strategy. We have to spend time on the audience research now, but it will be helpful for the future. We should research our audience beforehand even before beginning <a href="../6-web-development-steps-design-website/index.html">web development</a> of the mobile application and it could demonstrate exceedingly advantageous.</p>
<p>Target audience increases the opportunities of gaining success permanently.  </p>
<p>Moreover, audience research will enable us to add mobile app features and options depending on wants, interest or choices of our audience.</p>
<p>On the other hand, defining the right audience will also assist us to develop the best monetization plan and find out a robust mobile app specification. Audience research also enables us to start a compelling digital marketing campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The fundamental actions of managing Audience Research</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We live in an information century, and so many people have mobile devices or different electronic gadgets. They use a separate mobile application through iOS and Android systems. We can get from entertainment to learning features or from sport applications to navigation programs by these apps. We must admit that today to astonish users is not easy. And it is an essential case in the marketing strategy.</p>
<p>For example, some <a href="https://clutch.co/app-developers/resources/e-commerce-app-survey-2017/index.html">research results</a> show that more than 80% of mobile app users tend to make benefit from brands like the ones last acquired (within the eCommerce sector.) Therefore, experts think that the decision of audience research must be in two groups: 1) common sense; 2) research of fields.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Common sense</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In common sense, we attempt to learn the first resolution of our audience group and collect the data about major lines of our sector. For example, if our program is a vocabulary app, then our audience group would encompass all age groups. On the other hand, vocabularies are mainly connected with students for their subjects, and our particular target would be young people who are studying in university or colleges. However, we don't block other potential user groups, and they also can use our mobile app.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Research of fields</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, we must dive with an overall prospect and approach as it is a detailed examination in the research of fields. You must not forget to keep your eyes intact on the competitors and give special attention to people who would use the app more than others.</p>
<p>We must follow our opponent apps, their steps and improvement statistics. Also, it is essential to take into consideration our users who use the product more than other members. For instance, in the vocabulary application, we should focus take into account which online functions our users prefer, or to what extent they interest in paid vocabulary features. Other vital points are feedbacks from users, their suggestions and wants, application rating the reviews.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Changing over our digital marketing strategies more effective and using the services of professional services</p>
<p>We can find on the internet, and many services are suggesting their research services to the client. They are professional and can realize accurate research about our target audience. However, these services are costly and may be inappropriate to our marketing budget. Especially, if we are a startup, not a big company, then it wouldn't be suitable choices for us.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The temperate method for audience research</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If we can select the option which will not be expensive so why not to try it? In other words, there are some fair and clear programs and online statistic sites which can assist us in getting target audience data. For example, many marketers use Statista for their mobile app marketing. Statista provides digital marketing strategy with vital stats, reliable data or other elements associated with the audience, markets, and opponents. Furthermore, App Annie is also a useful tool. It suggests a particular digital marketing data. Likewise, everyone can find different programs which have a real profit to define the audience research.</p>
<p>By the way, Google also has impressive "features" for audience research. We mean that it is possible to get information about online statistics or search for data by <a href="../google-adwords-trends-2019/index.html">Google Adwords</a> and Google Trends. For example, if we identify that our members try to find particular idioms, we can add the idiom dictionary to our vocabulary app. Getting more information is also possible with Quora or Reddit which are question-and-answer websites.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Mobile app marketing and competition</h2>
<p><img alt="mobile-app-marketing" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/apz0UoqIwGbd81gWIeTJCZs93SL7vvAza-t_1tld56zrR7HvFM1jnqqz8mgvV82GSuioF5EcXU6yh4Cj6GBVrRkuHaOudsaUlSqXyqRQXZg5_NhW4OjgptU4v78M3tsQG5o2KJ2x" style="height:418px; width:665px"></p>
<p>We should also be focusing on what our opponents have been up to and understanding what has run and, perhaps, what has not run for the competitors. Nothing is going to damage the digital marketing strategy more than being perceived as a picture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we are creating a mobile app, and we notice that some of our opponents have already tested marketing it a unique method but failed.</p>
<p>Understanding our marketing strategy is not just about understanding our audience. It's also about identifying what our opponents have been doing so that we can continue original and appropriate.</p>
<p>Once we have decided our target audience, its time to investigate our opponent to identify what our program is in the mobile app industry. Statista records state that users currently can select from an approximated 7 million applications between the worlds best app markets. There so many options and opponent's analysis is a vital element of the digital marketing strategy to remain as a leader.</p>
<p>Reliable mobile application development possesses a product that increases the value for members and assists them to solve their problems. Nonetheless, our app marketing, at last, won't be profitable if the competition has more to suggest. So using some research methods provide ys to make a sharp point.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The unique value proposition for mobile app marketing</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Competitive research finds out our opponents advantages and disadvantages. The one point that we have to take into consideration is creating a different app with the opponent. Our services, all products mustn't be the same with other apps, and at this point, we can benefit from UVP. So, what is the unique value proposition? UVP - it the primary energy of our competitive power and is probably one of the essential conversion details for our mobile app.</p>
<p>The unique value proposition is the first thing we need to think in our digital marketing strategy. We can't count the unique value proposition as a positioning statement. Additionally, our mobile apps must persuade users to select our application over the active choices. The users must identify our unique value proposition firstly when they visit our mobile app. During the analyzing process of opponents, we can examine their unique value proposition to clarify the value of suggesting. Some necessary details will help us to make UVP:</p>
<p>- To find what the opponent carry out correctly</p>
<p>- Our pros and cons</p>
<p>- Their pros and cons</p>
<p>- The advantages of our solution and value for potential clients</p>
<p>When determining the unique value proposition, we should adjust a list of advantages that our mobile application suggests to our members. After making a list, we can add it to our value suggesting. Ultimately, we must differ our service, features from opponents and cleanly classify what we present users.</p>
<p>Many businesses fail to evaluate their full focused set precisely. The point is that if we don't get the pros and cons of our mobile app, we can't improve our product properly. If we don't know what advantages and drawbacks have our mobile app, then we can't "sell" our project successfully.</p>
<p>We have to distinguish and reach our UVP to commence our business apart from the rest of the sector. Several mobile app development agencies suggest <a href="../seo-friendly-web-design-developments/index.html">web designing</a> and review presentations assist us in setting primary purposes.  Sometimes, the group who want to launch a mobile app don't know where to start. We recommend them three factors: 1) marketable features; 2) vision statement of application; 3) audience research. All these three steps will help the app team to find out the competitive point.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>To identify the competitors in mobile app marketing</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Okay, now we possess the UVP, and it is time to estimate active and passive (or potential) opponents. First and foremost, we can adjust a list and include here five names that we suppose as real opponents. Then we will observe their advantages by a common search using standard keywords. Usually, other mobile apps use the same keywords which we have planned.</p>
<p>That's why we must compete for our users' attention. We recommend you to use a tool which encompasses information about the competition. What data will we need about our opponents? Revenue, suggestions, features, customer support, feedbacks, digital marketing strategy, and target audience, are vital factors that we should take into consideration. If we want to win our opponents, then we must increase our both app and customer relations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Making an opponent analysis table</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Knowing our opponents will do us no good if we don't test that information within the implementation. An opponent analysis table will help us in this work. You can see an example below:</p>
<p><img alt="opponent-analysis-table" src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/vcdygVnzCY_2ufgufgnS_uWE4QRK0zSTtBkXyb_OCUj4Go2n8xfzgLBbFoz_niHPZXnnZ6hcpnhIq0iF9kOY92wJr0Xq78nxkZPCOh5b9rkRxmZzPzBHvJtkpjU1ZEeBIv5RVblc" style="height:509px; width:665px"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/improving-mobile-app-competitive-analysis/index.html">Source</a></p>
<p>After getting information about the opponent's strength and potential sometimes, people give in this stage, because they decide that competition is very hard. That's why rigorous research and expectations are essential. After understanding all indicators of the opponent, we should look through our digital marketing strategy again and maybe realize some changes in our marketing plans.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Mobile App marketing and Monitoring</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="mobile-app-monitoring" src="../../lh5.googleusercontent.com/dECSrsJ7r1uzEDzbfvjQWt3DMND5jzgt2fW_rYIC1rz19z3FlLrnJNmi76ph7KVVjAp_O_pG_cbYcgHwqx5PrCpTUOF5OdsdXsLxfQEWFfKcfb0iLC1RGGsk8BrfieDFixaVrQzT" style="height:417px; width:665px"></p>
<p>Once the mobile application is available, and the mobile app marketing is in progress, that doesn't mean our marketing attempts are finished. The point that we ought to do as the dispatch pushes forward is watching out for our KPI. We should carefully monitor what users think about our mobile app, analyze the user feedback, also improve customer support.</p>
<p>Address any bugs quickly, if found and documented, and make sure that you remain as committed to the app, post-launch, as you were when you were developing it. If any defects or bugs show up, we must note it instantly, and share with our web development team. Never forget that a digital marketing strategy is useful if it gets not just many users but also good connections with them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we must take into account our mobile app marketing analytics. Maybe our some attempts are beneficial than others we must improve those part. For example, if our video contents drive better than others, it means, that we can focus on the videos. Always prefer a better digital marketing strategy to other ones.</p>
<p>From a user experience point of view, mobile app monitoring should support these factors:</p>
<p>User experience cases - Analyzing user experience performance, security and user satisfaction degree.</p>
<p>Concentrate on hardships - Contexts are critical. From app version to the user types, and from device type to operating systems a big field must be investigated.</p>
<p>Urgent problems are a priority - Useful metrics assist to detect development endeavors and quality assurance to balance business impression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's the manner by which this means an application monitoring planning:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Startup and resume time</h3>
<p>Time issues are essential to measure in monitoring for mobile app marketing. Restart process is usually long, compare with the program running in the background. Starting time influences the user experiences, so our job is to catch each of them. We should evaluate UI response time how app member understands it. Generally, mobile app monitoring estimated network request times (depends on the purpose of digital marketing strategy.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, the network is not a single issue in response times. Users interests when the operation finishes; they don't care about system response.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is better to evaluate response times by operational systems or device. It helps the mobile app marketing team to:</p>
<p>1) Concentrate on different systems at a time; 2) Observe and react to performance matters; 3) Specify both quality assurance and development resources respectively.</p>
<p>Both important: We estimate the speed of the user actions. However, put them by quality. We have to take into consideration problems that impact the most people and possess a severe business influence potential.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Crashes and their influence on mobile app marketing</h3>
<p>Crashes are dangerous cases for mobile apps and can influence all digital marketing strategy because crashes trigger user activity in the program. Therefore, we strongly recommend following crashes. Sometimes, we face with monitoring solutions which track other metrics, and they are not related to crashes. So, it is better to understand that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Which user actions bring about the crash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many mobile app users the crash influenced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many crashes influence our app</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions allow the mobile app team to detect which crashes are most dangerous.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Mobile App marketing and SEO</h2>
<p><img alt="mobile-app-marketing-seo" src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/IanCmf1PZQ2UA5HzRDn-USWM3C2ozbpxT87FfQjlddlsz9VUt-eRRDCxQoPE_tYY9PpxSLCejAzDH250GeP5yLn4mFOtT0hqdWjORRKZYkSalJxh9Tqd1B6pjZbu3kdoQbL997qN" style="height:418px; width:665px"></p>
<p>There are many ways to affect the appearance of your mobile app in mobile search. Mobile engine update of Google changed mobile app marketing and searched significantly. This update allows to show up your mobile app in the Search Engine Result Page (SERP) and also suggest the one-click button to install the application quickly. Nowadays, competition in the mobile application marketing is growing, but before diving into the details, it is essential to know why it is necessary to spend your money and time in search engine optimization for mobile app marketing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Importance of app SEO in Digital Marketing Strategy</p>
<p>Why become actively visible in mobile search results? Why not? Statistics show that each passing year mobile traffic is growing more than the desktop. In comparison with 2017, mobile traffic increased its share from 50.3 % to 52.2 % in 2018. (Statista, 2018). That is why it is becoming more and more important to pay special attention to your mobile app marketing to increase your visibility in mobile search. The primary purpose of investing in app SEO is not only targeting new users but also keeping your existing customer base.</p>
<p><img alt="all-global-webpages-served-to-mobile" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/1Lxij0R7UZGQ2XMh4FAu7NPC52xFzhEnGr7MN5nHDKH6qPlzWvAW2FkXqQjtDX1gzrwR-TdQvqc1grhMXoD1pJMIDCI6QxWsOHvvlU7k7iceTTx9RX1Gm7rFA6R1vz86cSHwjqCp" style="height:473px; width:665px"></p>
<p>What are the main methods to discover the app?</p>
<p>Mobile application users commonly use the Google Play Store for Android and App Store for IOS systems to install an application. Many people already decide which application to install before clicking to those stores. But how people discover applications? Google started research to measure customer usage and found that 48 % of smartphone users browse for <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/_qs/documents/331/how-users-discover-use-apps-google-research.pdf/index.html">apps in the stores</a>. What are the other app discovery methods?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="methodes-of-app-discovery" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/vA4U-F9IFbGT6cKGVtWXylE52pPcJF0xLOX5hmMm7DcHzuTxWeSSgJnpnC_65jgbCRGFkq5e3Zte-eMJBQ4_7z382V316_VCTw9t95zPhv5AjGDvmxF7dAfFndi9IU4jm2XGN4iC" style="height:243px; width:665px"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/apps/app-marketing-trends-mobile-landscape/index.html">Source</a></p>
<p>In the first sight, you might think that people mainly discover the apps based on the information they receive from their family and friends. But think twice& The graph shows you that the vast part of the users discovers the applications as a result of search ads. How? 34 % of people got a recommendation in the app stores; 33 % of people saw an ad while using another app; while  31 % of people saw an ad while browsing the web; finally, 20 % of people discovered the mobile application by an add on YouTube.</p>
<p>These are all the sum of the result of search ads, which is higher more than twice in comparison with another discovery method. These statistics may give you an insight into the<a href="../why-seo-more-than-just-rankings/index.html"> importance of SEO</a>. If you still not thinking about it, it means that you are ready to risk your business by losing the massive part of your potential customer.</p>
<p>Besides, visibility in Google search result is another nuclear SEO factor that has an influence on your business, as 21 % of people discover mobile app via search engines. If you are not visible enough in Google Search engines, you are again risking a considerable amount of potential traffic.</p>
<p>To sum up, if you do not want to risk your potential customer traffic to application installation and to be successful in mobile app marketing you MUST invest in app SEO.</p>
<p>Key factors to be successful in-app SEO.</p>
<p>Are we now on the same page that the app SEO is highly important for mobile app marketing? If yes, then lets continue and see what we should pay attention to become successful in-app SEO. The first two factors that influence the app SEO are almost the same with common SEO factors which are Title & Keywords and Quality Backlinks. The third and trendy one among mobile apps is Ratings & Reviews.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Title &Keyword factor is the very first important factor to consider in your app SEO. Application Store (Play Store and App Store) is a crowded and growing marketplace, which creates a real challenge for the users to find the application they are looking for.  That is why it is essential to be sure that you choose the right name for your app. On the other hand, entering the correct list of keywords are even more vital.</p>
<p>You can benefit from Googles tool such as <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/index.html">Google Keyword Suggest tool</a>, or you can also use other keywords suggest tools, for example, app tweaks, etc. Once the keywords identified, try to put it to the title of your application and description. It is essential to keep in mind that professionals do not recommend to have the app title more than 30 characters.</p>
<p>Being the backbone of SEO strategy, Quality Backlinks are very important for app SEO as well. More quality <a href="../ultimate-backlink-building-strategies-2019/index.html">backlinks building</a> you have, the better you will have an app position. You may start the website of your app. If your website has a strong backlink, it means that the authority of your application increases linked from this site. By becoming active in social media such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, etc. you can also increase link to your app.</p>
<p>Ratings and Reviews are the third critical factor which is specific for app SEO.  Reviews are the objective way of describing the views of customers. It is one of the trusted marketing and is an excellent source for progress, which means that not only good reviews affect your business positively, but also bad comments allows you to improve. It is essential to select the right time for promoting the rating of your app. Do not forget that the quantity of scores is also critical as the quality of the ratings. To have a good app store search results, you should have enough number of ratings, decent rating average and a proper amount of app reviews.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How users find your app?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In the paragraphs as mentioned earlier, we talked about how generally you can promote your mobile app marketing. In addition to all specified points, you also need to work on the following steps to make sure that you have a robust digital app marketing strategy and your app ranking is high.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>General Google Search. - When people do a general web search to find relevant application in Google, it suggests an application package (App Pack). For instance, if you look for Dictionary app, you will receive the app pack of various recommended dictionary apps.</p>
<p>Each of the suggested apps contains the name, icon, rating, and information about the price. Based on the <a href="https://blog.searchmetrics.com/us/mobile-app-rankings/index.html">research of Searchmetrics</a>, one in ten mobile searches in Google now include a suggested App Pack. Bear in your mind that a significant amount of your potential users prefer to google your app, rather than searching for it in the app stores. If you have strong app SEO and you pay particular attention to all factors, it will positively influence your appearance ranking in app pack.  Do not forget to benefit from best practices in order to make sure that you have not skipped any point for a great initiation.</p>
<p><img alt="google-search" src="../../lh5.googleusercontent.com/2GpklyFnZzEXL61nssno-TkZ_WBANB1xPOO9A6rg02fCVErIeUGzIJfNXc3IgrnRbPPazawQecKQ_Jl2UV0p8wiuUF-jLc4dCJx-9mkFWQx5hpQHOTZNbP_zati2igS054lrvgAu" style="height:422px; width:226px"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Single Brand Search. - When people search for a specific brand by typing the name of particular features, the search engine shows a preview of that app from the app store. In addition to the information in the app pack in a single search, you can also see the app description and install button. When you click to install switch a new screen pops up for installing the app. The example below is shown for an application Pes 2019 Pro Evolution Soccer.</p>
<p><img alt="google-search-results" src="../../lh5.googleusercontent.com/DxRwSPckv8UazL_d-sHilS6yVMf24EaQfjVdvJOT-bQdxbpo-f2ChKTnEW6GJRZmTXDEmufB2UKaylrC-ar4QRfRdq5Bgun__NruXoBis0A-4F-Cvpd5MP-7SUBk26aPGpeP2BeI" style="height:284px; width:439px"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Specific Content Search - When a user has already installed your app and search for particular content in Google, <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-indexing/index.html">Firebase App indexing</a> helps the user to open the result directly in the app. App indexing helps your users to re-engage to the app. That is why integrating your app to App indexing extends your ranking performance in <a href="../key-steps-rise-top-search-results-google-search/index.html">Google Search</a>.  As you can see from the example, we searched for global bond market in google, and as a result, Google suggested two top recent stories from Bloomberg, because the application of Bloomberg already installed in the phone.</p>
<p>Beside reengaging current users, it also helps to attract new users. If the users who do not have your app installed to their mobile, search for the specific content that relevant to your app, App Indexing provokes installation for your app in the search results.</p>
<p><img alt="google-search-results" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/olZCXIYOq3gizHeC69QZxOJEm32uAiDq36Q-hS0KvzEeWlPREz-oobNkkSI908mYVymbLUdghQUo160dn2Tpouisijlh8jSVQ5MYfSCX5C6RT09AMGiC2ErIkAwJDhVtI5w_oZRv" style="height:428px; width:249px"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Visibility in App Store Search- App Store Optimization (ASO)</p>
<p>We discussed all details of making app rank high in web search results, but what about the users that discover your application by browsing app stores. Lets not forget that 48 % of users <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/_qs/documents/331/how-users-discover-use-apps-google-research.pdf/index.html">discover apps</a> via app stores, which is not a small number to ignore.  When we talk about app store marketing, we should know about ASO - <a href="../app-store-optimization-right-way-2019/index.html">App Store Optimization</a>.</p>
<p>What is ASO? How it differs from SEO? ASO is the optimization process of the visibility of your app in mobile app stores. Sometimes people confuse ASO and SEO. Actually, they are similar, and both are created to improve your profile in the virtual world. The main difference between them is that ASO focuses mainly on app stores, while SEO is more concentrated on web searches.</p>
<p>In order to optimize ASO, you should pay particular attention to keywords, the title of the application, number of downloads and ratings and reviews. To have priority in app store search results, you should select your app title, subtitle, keyword, and description of your app strategically. Once you carefully choose all of them, it can influence app store algorithm indexes.</p>
<p>You can use different tools to track your ranking such as app tweaks, app radar, etc. For example, app tweak offers you free tools such as keyword auto-suggestion, counter, shuffler, algorithm change detector, ASO guide, etc. At the same time, the site has other services which are offered in charge, which provides you with the data you need to increase the visibility of your app.</p>
<p>You can test it in 7 days of trial period. Besides the use of the app tools to track your ranking, you should also pay particular attention to high average app rating, number of app download and user reviews. There are several indicators such as user engagement, retention, app performances show the quality of your app. By working on your app continuously, you will achieve a high ranking in search results, which will let you have increased revenue and loyal users.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, if you manage to be successful in search optimization both in SEO and ASO, it will help you to boost your app business.</p>
