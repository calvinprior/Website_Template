Link building is the keystone of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). In order to become the first in the ranking system of search engines (e.g., Google) and beat the competitors, it is essential to pay particular attention to the<a href="../6-backlink-building-mistakes-you-need-avoid/index.html"> link building strategy</a> of the website.</p>
<h3>What is link building and why it is important for SEO?</h3>
<p>Briefly, link building is the process of establishing relevant hyperlinks (usually called links) to a website from external sites. To win the competition, you should understand the purpose of the link building activities. As the search engines are based on links, the more relevant links you have, the more actively you will be shown in the queries of the searches and targeted customer base will be directed your website. It is important to highlight that, the quality of the links helps you to achieve a higher rank rather than the number of irrelevant links. So, in order to have the best rank you should have:<br>
"    The high number of backlinks;<br>
"    Source of relevant sites;<br>
"    High Domain Authorities (e.g., Google, Youtube, etc.).</p>
<p>Nowadays, extensive information can be found on this issue, and therefore rather than concentrating the general information, We decided to consolidate them all and come up with more precise link building strategies for the upcoming year. Here is step by step Ultimate Backlink Building Strategies for 2019:</p>
<p><img alt="backlink-building-strategy" src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/nRzTmMJbdCpU92ZCeM_Xg2378ogpwxM_znwV9x74R-hzfGf5hHR6T_3dA34VYW-6NywgXxxgstLbQVUumNfxmdeW-Bi-VNpV42YpqxpXTMAYOq-CI1zdnwNvpgQ1NGBz9SKmFEEd" style="height:403px; width:602px"><br>
 </p>
<p>Audit backlinks and create your backlink building strategy:<br>
It is essential to conduct the link audit of the website on a regular basis to avoid the risks and explore the opportunities. Many people do not know that if you build dangerous and unhealthy backlinks, Google can penalize your website.  It allows you to see where you can gain even more high-value links, which will probably boost the performance of your site and move your rankings up. It is also possible to benefit from your competitors backlink.</p>
<p><br>
Backlink audit is supposed to be costly and time-consuming when agencies do it. So why not to do it and create the link building strategies by ourselves, and save our time and money?</p>
<p>In a nutshell, we will show you in four points how to audit the backlinks?</p>
<p><strong>1. Do pre-audit research</strong> - it is highly recommended to conduct pre-audit research before starting the audit itself. It gives you a surface opinion about the backlink building strategies of the competitors. In order to be helpful, we recommend you to start competitor analysis via <a href="https://majestic.com/index.html">majestic.com</a> which is available in 11 languages and allow you to do a competitor analysis only in few seconds. The only thing to do is to type the URL of your competitor and magnifying glass button (in orange color).</p>
<p><strong>2. Explore the backlinks</strong> - Once you completed with your short competitor analysis, it is time to explore and find the links that directed the search traffic to your site. There are thousands of websites that work on the link building strategies, but based on the personal experience Google Search Console could be your best friend on this issue with updated, accurate information and accessible data about your link strategies.</p>
<p>To see how Google Search Console (webmaster) works click <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/#?modal_active=none/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analyses of the backlinks</strong> - Analyze part of the audit takes more time in comparison with the first to steps. Two methods can be applied at this point of the time.<br>
Manual Evaluation- As it is obvious from the name, in this option all the links will be controlled manually and visited one by one. The main cons of the link building method are that if you have plenty of links, then it will be quite a time-consuming and exhausting.<br>
Automatic Evaluation- By using a link analysis tool, you can save your time and increase accuracy.  Here are our few suggestions on link analysis tool such as Majestic, <a href="https://www.semrush.com/features/backlink-audit-tool/index.html">SEMrush Backlink Audit</a>. Maybe you use various tools, but it is essential to pay attention to pay particular attention to the points mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>List of backlinks- in particular, list of unhealthy backlinks</strong><br>
Domain Authority<br>
Page Authority</p>
<p><strong>4. Link Penalty check</strong> - before processing to the final step of the backlink audit, spend your few minutes to make sure that you do not have any links that receive the penalties. Two penalties can be found:<br>
Manual penalties- which is detected by the Google team personally while visiting the profile and seeing the acquired links. These kinds of circumstances are mainly faced when Google is notified about spam reports on the website that require human review.<br>
Algorithmic penalties- the penalty applies when <a href="https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/index.html">Googles algorithm</a> is alerted by the something in the link placed in your profile.<br>
The penalties are both quite harmful, and cause fell in inbound traffic to your website and loss in ranking - however, no need to be stressed, because the links can be recovered from the penalties.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>5. Make a Plan:</strong> - before achieving this step you have to be done with your link profile audit. Backlink audit is precious only if you plan to take further steps and prepare the action plan. In order to help you to adjust the plan of action, I mention a few points to consider:</p>
<p>- Link penalty recovery;<br>
- Fix of dead backlink;<br>
- Improvement of Domain and Page authority.<br>
 </p>
<h2>Guest posting to other blogs</h2>
<p>Guest posting is vital for building backlink strategies to your website. In order to achieve good guest posting, you have to indicate blogs with strong root domain authorities. Before doing the guest posting, you have to be sure that:</p>
<p>1. The content is highly relevant to your working area;<br>
2. The targeted audience is interested in your blog;<br>
3. The number of readers is enough to engage in your blog;<br>
4. The blog owners reputation and activity are high.<br>

Decreasing these pitfalls in your website and explore the opportunities in the other web pages, it is necessary to check the broken links periodically and work on them. Broken link building acquires links by finding the broken links and reproduce the content of it, by this opportunity it helps the webmaster to convert broken links into your corrected link.

<h3>Create nice infographics and promote it</h3>
<p>We observe infographics very often, but content creators usually underrate pros of infographics. Frankly speaking, an infographic is still a simple method to collect attention. An infographic can increase users eagerness to read content 80 percent (it is about people's interest in colored visuals). When the particular work goes into them, infographics can surely be useful for contextual link building.<br>
As long as they are informative, realistic, fun, and eye-catching, they can be an excellent way to display spirit leadership. Infographics also help us create more variety in our content, all while alluring links from others are sharing our infographic on their web pages or social media profiles. Here are some guides for how to use infographics efficiently for link building strategies: We hope that with the assistance of these keys you can build more links.</p>
<h3>Target the Leader</h3>
<p>Doing an infographic about a significant brand in your industry is always a good idea. No, any company, even top dogs can be against it, as visually appealing infographics gives interesting data about the companies. As a result, it will assist you to build your link building strategy and promote your services. Creating an infographic about a good brand in your industry and sharing it in your website, as well as, in social media, not only promoting your specialization area but also helps your services to be shared by other followers or subscribers of the same brand. It is also necessary to tag industry publications that related to your infographic topic on social media. As the hashtags are quite popular in the social media today, do not forget that to add related hashtags to assure that your infographics are addressed rightly. Bear in mind that if you share one publication with exactly the same words but tagging different writing or company each time, social media might consider it as spam.</p>
<h3>Be original! Use unique data and artwork</h3>
<p>How to catch the attention of the leaders in your industry? It is vital to be creative and describe what they want to say. Do not avoid to use a <a href="../branding/index.html">graphic designer</a> to create a unique artwork that displays the facts clearly and precisely. For instance, if the information is about the quotes from the experts, you can use just caricatures of them, to make the story more eye-catching. However, if it is mainly about figures and facts, you need to focus on the original data. As the data will be unique and have not been seen before, the potential followers most probably will be more willing to share it, which will positively affect your reputation. Try to concentrate on the new findings of the data and touch the topics that have not been discussed before. Sharing new ideas will give a reason for the targeted users to promote your work.</p>
<h3>Explore Out Sources</h3>
<p>If you pull the data from outsources, remember that you should not take it from someone elses infographics directly. Try to use the benefits of outsourcing information to your interests.<br>
It is very beneficial and ethical to let the authors or company know that you are using their information by adding credit them in your infographics and sending an email to an author or any other key contact person. You can use Hunter or LinkedIn to find the contact information of the person you are looking for. In order to catch the attention and make everything even more simple, you can share in advanced prepared statuses or tweets to trigger them to post it instantly. The company that you are sourcing the data from will be interested in sharing your infographics since it gives credit to them. So it is essential to make it easy to share the post and not to leave them a room for ignorance.</p>
<h3><br>
Reach Outlet Publications</h3>
<p>Outlet Publication is one of a good way of promoting your infographic. In these kinds of publications, you ask them to link directly to your infographics rather than linking to your blog. This kind of posts gives them new, easy to share content and it takes even less than an hour to summarize the findings of the infographics. However, how to find the right publications? You need to explore blogs and websites, in order to check if they shared anything about infographics, formerly. You can also search it in social media with the hashtag of infographics. In case you find some tweet or blog post, this might be a good introduction for you to start your conversation with them. Try to make an individual approach for each outlet, and do not just copy and paste one e-mail to them all.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Keep republishing your infographics</h3>
<p>Nowadays, visual social media platforms become popular. Taking advantage of the development in visual social media platforms, you can share your infographics by creating your account in there. For example, many websites, bloggers, and publications receive massive reference benefit from Pinterest, which has 250 million monthly users according to the <a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en/audience-demographics-user-stats/index.html">statistics of Pinterest</a>.</p>
<p><br>
SlideShare is another social media, where you can present your infographics, too.  You can increase the number of views of your infographics by sharing it on SlideShare, even if you have already published it before on your website.<br>
As long as you link to the source of your infographics Medium or LinkedIn Publisher might be considered as an excellent place to republish it.<br>
We also advise you to republish the infographics in Visual.ly  community, which has a similar format to Pinterest. As the site is one of the top searches for finding infographics, many people may refer to this site in order to find infographics in the specific topics.<br>
<br>
In a nutshell, using infographics is always one of the effective ways in your link building strategy, regardless you are sharing it in industry publications, social media or somewhere else. Infographics create more visually attractive content for users. It is necessary to consider building more eye-catching, engaging and beneficial infographics in your link building strategy to receive more traffic, credibility follows and shares in your sphere.<br>
 </p>
<h2>Create video content and link it to the website</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>When Google crawls our site, the spiders are searching for some indicators like keyword instances, page quality, and relevance. Video objects bring extra values to these three metrics. Furthermore, videos also improve a Time On Page of the user, a key indicator of page quality which we suppose that becomes more crucial day by day. It is crystal clear that people are keen on to link to the posts if the content includes qualitative multimedia materials. We can call it the SEO benefits of Video Content, and thats why the experts count video contents as an element of backlink building strategy.</p>
<p>Owners of E-commerce sites should also strictly think about putting videos in different locations like product pages. Apart from the added quality and stickiness linked to the product pages, they also contribute us to attract on the Search Engine Results Page with the annex of a video thumbnail. When Google crawls, the page spiders are searching for signals to register that our content is relevant to an asked question.  A page with a Headline 1 title and an embed code is not transferring Google the message that this page is full of unique, similar content. Google isn't able to render video content at all so we can send better algorithmic signals to the Big G via encompassing our already awesome video with equally effective text and images.  This "unskillfulness" of Google also benefits us with another chance to target the<a href="../why-seo-more-than-just-rankings/index.html"> SEO keywords</a> we are after. Take into consideration that resources for the users are inevitable because the visitors can get more information on the headline by these resources. When they enter the site, we should provide them with more reasons to connect to our video. For instance, telling a story about how we produced video or summarized the contents of the video are suitable methods.  Additionally, we have a chance to demonstrate other, related videos to hold the user who interests more as engaged as feasible. The point is that we should organize our website for users that they will easily access linkable resources and regularly reference them in the future.</p>
<p><img alt="backlink building guide 2019" src="../media/media/ckeditor_uploads/2019/02/20/backlink2_rqL3TVq.png" style="height:434px; width:650px"></p>
<h2>Use backlink in your signature in the forums</h2>
<p><br>
The search engines like Google, Yahoo or Bing always pinpoint our signature links. However, as profile links, where we can make thousands almost directly, they aren't counted as much as say a high PR link on a news web page inside of well-prepared content. Although not many <a href="../differences-between-result-driven-affordable-s/index.html">SEO link building</a> specialists are using forum backlinks, these are among the useful link building methods. Some specialists emphasize it as one of the most robust links to have.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>1st step</strong> - Finding the relevant forums to our niche.</h4>
<p>The quick way we can do it by using keywords or Google operators. For instance, if we need to get a forum in an 'SEO niche,' then search in Google as 'SEO inurl: forum.' The process is that; the query will search for SEO related sites that have 'forum' in the URL, and it will guide us directly to the forum page of the appropriate URL we choose from the Google.</p>
<h4><strong>2nd step</strong> - Choose the websites that may be fit for us to build forum links on click on it.</h4>
<p>The point is that we may also find other web pages in between that would guide us to other real forum meetings. We will skip it and go on.</p>
<h4><strong>3rd step</strong> - Aware of the rules of the forum.</h4>
<p>Commonly, each forum board has different positions and different layouts. That's why browsing throughout the site would be the right decision. Some of the places where we can get are 1. Inside the original forum threads as sticky posts, we will 1st message that Forum Admins will send us, at the footer bottom.</p>
<h4><strong>4th step</strong> - Registering ourselves by clicking the relevant button (sign up or register).</h4>
<p>Usually, forums put it at below or the top of right the header or some other side. We want to underline that, a forum has been among the top backlink building sources for SEO experts and Forum boards deliberately keeps the 'Sign up' or 'Register' button at various parts to stay away from spam registrations.</p>
<h4><strong>5th step</strong> - Checking our mailbox to submit and confirm the registration.</h4>
<p>We will receive the mail to the email address that we have entered during the registration. The one point is that sometimes, the email services will delay the letter due to some situations like server manual verification or congestion.</p>
<h4><strong>6th step</strong> - Waiting for the Forum Admins' response.</h4>
<p>Even after submitting the mail, users may be put on waiting for the line until Admin manually adjusts the membership status to 'available.' It may take approximately five minutes to a week depending on the availability of admins.</p>
<h4><strong>7th step</strong> - Reread the Rules in advance: It is obligatory.</h4>
<p>Virtually all the Forum boards pick the same IP Banned lists so if one forum board bans our IP address; other forum boards will automatically ban us too. Therefore, checking the rules well before making the first post will be useful.</p>
<h4><strong>8th step</strong> - Sharing our post in the Forum.</h4>
<p>Now we know how and when to share our first post. In order to control the spam activity, forum boards have robust states on the internet, and even it has two types of controlling: auto-moderation and human reduction. Thus, we should begin posting discreetly after analyzing all the rules connected to the link, related to the forum and related to the thread category we are deciding to display.</p>
<h4><strong>9th step</strong> - Building links.</h4>
<p>Post links and Signature links are two types of links in the forums. When we post links manually inside the posts, we write in threads; these are 'Post links.' However, when we insert our links in the Signature area which we will regularly notice in the user control panel menu at the top, these are signature links. Both post links and signature links have some pros and cons. Signature links are stable, so these will be the same in all the posts it, and our task is simpler to post links. By the way, we might never be able to be found in a forum board if we have permission to signatures. That's why it is necessary first to check user panel and obtain the signature tab. If we do not get it, then we should continue to search threads using the search bar possible on forum board with the keyword signature. Then by reading all the postings, it is easy to know how and where to use a signature if it is available.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is profitable to experience that some signatures support either bb codes or<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_html.asp/index.html"> HTML tags</a> or nothing. These differ at each forum boards mostly. What about the other link type - the post links? Every link that we insert within a post is post link. All forums have formatting options, and so we can choose the keyword we want to post the link on and come about the 'URL' option at the top and enter the URL which we try to link to, we can also have naked URLs in the post, but these all depend on the forum sites.<img src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9Vu3iVmyXDYBGTZuLUuP-2DlzlkfMgvRa68CBKLACnR2EeomGUQxBMYJTJPa3s1G3HS8ni8C1CF3gUGxrE7KXsVizeWKWX2VUMRzYTGVHujI8Il9aatAJD5dmXeqmKvxy5FHts3" style="height:487px; width:602px"></p>

<h2>Promote your article in the Q&A websites</h2>
<p>Q&A websites are "questions and answers" sites which indicate inquiries, comments, articles about millions of topics. The most popular Q&A websites are <a href="https://www.quora.com/index.html">Quora</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/index.html">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://www.answeree.com/index.html">Answeree</a>, <a href="https://whatifhq.com/index.html">What If? HQ</a>, etc. Q&A websites are current trends in content marketing. Q&A websites present the possibility to introduce yourself and your organization as industry leaders, which supports to promote your business and <a href="../get-juicy-SEO-traffic-gaming-site/index.html">improve traffic to website</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The researches prove that Q&A websites have advantages in the promotion and they possess real marketing potential.</h3>
<p>Q&A websites are able to list user-generated questions and answers on all varieties of topics. For example, Quora has approximately half a million subjects to discuss. Q&A sites let you obtain presentation to an extended audience. If you provide a variety of topics, it means that your organization can get its target group in one of the Q&A website niches.  Users share their opinions about answers and threads through pluses and minuses, using upvotes and downvotes or saying that the answer is useful or vice versa. Hence, the most prominent responses differ from the crowd. There are various advantages of using Q&A websites for the promotion of your article or website, and they consist of:</p>
<p><em>To improve website traffic: </em>Within answering questions, you take the chance to advertise your articles, services, products, and brands as well. This method is a great traffic booster and lead generator.</p>
<p><em>To attract new customers:</em> The first benefit of Q&A websites guides to the second profit. You can get new customers for your goods because more people will know about your organization and your brands.</p>
<p><em>To strengthen SEO:</em> If you can give users appropriate answers in your topics of interest, then well-known Q&A providers will be able to develop your website SEO. The logic is not difficult: The users of these Q&A websites see qualitative answers and click outbound links to your webpage, where they can find more useful content. If you can provide users with good solutions, you get a significant opportunity to boost the overall search engine ranking of the webpage.</p>
<p><em>To learn about the target audience:</em> Since users put full-length questions, you can examine users' way of thinking, what they consider about and detect what your possible customers have in mind. This coherence enables you to customize your suggestion according to the needs of customers and stay frequently informed with the latest industry improvements.</p>

<h2>Repurpose and syndicate your content</h2>
<p>Why should you repurpose your contents? How does it affect your backlink building strategy? Repurposing your content is not a simple process, even if you are an experienced content creator. Furthermore, the profits of repurposing are clear. Your contents have a better opportunity of being found when it shows up in many areas online. Whether users can easily find your materials, then they will be familiar with your business. The point is that making your content published in many locations can be a great approach to send traffic back to your website. A good level of traffic is essential for link building strategy. However, repurposing content also brings up many thoughts and questions. For example, there are some considers like publishing the contents on other platforms will negatively influence our websites SEO. The same issue appears when people ask to syndicate one of the posts on his or her site. If these arguments are right doubts, then you must watch out about taking a few single actions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Repurpose your content on Medium</strong>.<a href="https://medium.com/@alogenius33/37-creative-ways-to-repurpose-your-content-657c428c3564/index.html"> Publishing content to Medium</a> is quick and straightforward. The point is, though, the platform provides you with a method to repurpose your content and possibly reach hundreds, if not thousands, of new users. The first thing you should carry out is to start creating a free account. If youve signed in, then you can click on your profile picture or icon and choose stories. Your goal is to repurpose your content which you published on your website (or blog). That's why you should select the Import Story option. Now, all you need to enter the URL that guides to the content of the website you want to repurpose. The program will import all of your contents, each image, and formatting like bolded text, subheadings, links, etc. If you lose any of the formats, you can correct the content before publishing it on Medium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repurpose your contents on LinkedIn. </strong>Repurposing your posts on LinkedIn presents another avenue for getting new users and developing the online presence. On the other hand, repurposing contents on LinkedIn is not as straightforward. After you sign in LinkedIn, go to the Home tab, and head to news feeds top where you can see the choice to write a LinkedIn post. There you will see Write an Article and please click on it. By clicking this button, you will start the publishing tool in a new tab. By the way, repurposing your contents on LinkedIn is not automatic like on Medium where it just demands only a few clicks. You have to manually copy and paste the content into the LinkedIn publishing tool and format correctly them. Please, take into consideration that repurposing on LinkedIn may be weaker than it is on Medium. The reason is that you do not technically import your contents into LinkedIn, the platform doesnt suggest canonical tags to its articles, nor is there a form for you to do so. Nevertheless, many content writers do cross-post the posts to LinkedIn and have reported that original content still performs well in search engine results. To improve the possibility that your content will outrank repurposed content on LinkedIn, do not instantly repurpose the post. It usually takes approximately from a day to a week for search engines to index the content posts. It means that you ought to wait at least a couple of days or a couple of weeks before you will republish the article on LinkedIn. Finally, make sure that you add some backlinks to your website in the LinkedIn article. Moreover, you should give a sentence stating where the article initially showed up. As an additional step, do not skip to include your URL to the post. It is especially vital on LinkedIn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Syndicate your posts.</strong> Syndication means that another website republishes your content. Websites which syndicate content often take a high traffic volume and many post articles every day. We want to mention sites that syndicate content from other resources. For example, HuffPost, Inc., Slate or Thrive Global. Because your content will show up on favorite websites, syndication can give your site and reputation a severe increase. To come about syndication chances, you will need to spend a bit of time examining major media websites which you want to view your blog content appears. One method is to realize an Internet search for the words originally appeared on. This phrase will show articles that were republished from one website to another and can be a high beginning time for gaining syndication chances. If you already have some websites in your brain, also explore for originally appeared on + name of publication For example, you want to see if Inc. syndicates content, plug originally appeared in + Inc.com in the search button. The results prove that Inc. does real syndicate content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="backlink-building-strategy" src="../../lh5.googleusercontent.com/eCSfqtiF1K68gmSxPaiPyA0bNf5fwxSoeCdh8-_1BWq6MD2-91aemx-X498rfGFRGb7xwHhiZ9jAB7B7R1A0eLPsPZo0PxTsavTxWkddww3RCo8XUMNeC24KiKwimj3JOdAV8XyS" style="height:357px; width:602px"></p>
<p><br>
 </p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>Find other blogs for writing.</strong> There is a difference between syndication and guest blogging. Guest blogging is your original contents for another website or blog. You may be thinking why you should write content for other sites when you could spend that time on developing your websites. Guest blogging and content syndication provide you access to a broad audience. Some people suppose that it is not easy to find blogs which accept guest posts. However, there is no difficulty in this case. You can check the websites which allow guest posts are looking for links similar to write for us, writers guidelines, become a contributor, guest blogging and so on. Usually, you can see the information on the home menu or at the bottom of the website. Sometimes you can find it on the contact page. There are many websites or blogs that decline guest posts. With the assistance of an online search, you can locate blogs in your niche. This method is related to the search used to look for syndication possibilities. For example, you can use a formula that contains (the niche of yours) + (write for us or other given phrases above).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Republishing guest contents on your website.</strong> If granted admission for republishing the guest content on your site, take benefit from the chance, given it matches your editorial plan. You have spent all the time writing an exciting guest post, so it is right to take a little more use out of it. Thinking your website users did not notice the guest post, this will contribute your writing more reach and less waste of time. To republish a content written for another website or blog is only an element of giving content to your blog platform as you would if making a new post. Don't worry to add a canonical tag because your purpose is to drive traffic to your website. Perhaps, sometimes you will think about giving a note saying where your content originally seemed. In this situation, your goal is not for SEO, but rather to underline your activity as a published writer. All your energy and effort which goes into writing content only means to obtain more mileage out of the contents you have already done. Repurposing content on social media platforms, syndicating on famous websites and guest postings on other sites will help you to improve your visibility and audience reach and to save enough time.</p>

<h2>Promote your website in the forum's website review section</h2>
<p><img alt="backlink-building-strategy" src="../media/media/ckeditor_uploads/2019/02/20/seo_7qLnnhK.png" style="height:225px; width:680px"></p>
<p><a href="../contact/index.html">SEO experts</a> usually analyze two methods of website promotion in the forum's website review section. They use it regularly as a level of link building. However, there are different thoughts about using various methods.</p>
<p>The first method is the Spam Forums. The Spam Forums contains a group of different strategies that all finish in the same thing, arranging as many links as possible from forum web pages to our website. Usually, links come from forum messages or other web pages such as the forum profile. You may attend forums and post articles yourself, or you may designate different people to carry out it. Moreover, you can use automated scripts to control the whole process automatically. Nevertheless, there is an excellent opportunity that you will observe some basic success by using forum spam, but it is not a profitable strategy in the long run. Even automated scripts sometimes cannot manage the return on investment. You might end up with quite many links, but they will probably be low quality, not clear to search engines. Perhaps, forum spam will end up causing more hurt than profit to your website in the long run.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are some suspects about these methods, and maybe it will not benefit you about your link building strategy goals. Therefore we strictly recommend you to use the second method which called Engaging in Forums. In this method like forum spam, one of our aims is to get links to the website. However, in Engaging in Forums method, we are not going to take risks compare with Forum Spam. We will be looking for some of the similar sorts of links that spammers seek (for example, a homepage link and signature link in our profile), but we may also assume for additional links within the information, especially a few various links that lead to different parts of our website. We will also be more attentive about getting links in the correct context.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem that the administration of these websites sees each of our self-promotions with doubt. It continues until we are a trusted, established member of the forum. So be watchful at the beginning of the process, because they will probably treat as a spammer with you.</p>
