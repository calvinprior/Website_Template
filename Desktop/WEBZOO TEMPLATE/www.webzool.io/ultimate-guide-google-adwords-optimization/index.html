<p>Once you have carefully planned the AdWords campaign, your job will be far from done. You will have to work on it even more carefully after you launch the ads. It is vital to monitor how ads perform and make small changes for Google AdWords optimization reasons. Google AdWords campaign with the best plan can fail to bring expected results if its left unmanaged even if you appear on<a href="../key-steps-rise-top-search-results-google-search/index.html"> top of the search results</a>. You will get all the required data regarding the exact phrases searched by people while your ad was live. It is easy there to determine which keywords are getting clicks but not conversions. You should remove them from the list as they dont prove to be relevant to your business. Removing them is essential for optimization of Google Adwords. It will cut you</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What is Google Adwords Optimization?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="google-adwords" src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/c3typX7yXZpH8kxvh7bKCdEbVVWVQs3IbIyW4vlPGu8U7N8pmMclpKcLi0lLF4MGkZSu0OfbBi3MxewbVQWFgmkdRHqM1QAbsGAX5KrrZKyrD4kL5QMyQDLaUX6hbmE_Oetl2BNb" style="height:416px; width:624px"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>AdWords Optimization is the process of fine-tuning the Google AdWords campaign to achieve the maximum results once you have decided that <a href="../is-google-adwords-good-for-your-business/index.html">Google AdWords </a>is for your business. It is based on reducing ad waste and increasing ROI. When you get the Google AdWords live, there will be three main fields that have to be constantly observed and enhanced. The main fields are called three ingredients. All of the optimization efforts should be concentrated in these areas.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Ad Targeting</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>  Advertisements have to be targeting customers who have a high potential for buying products or services. If you neglect this step, your business will have a tough time making sales and improving it's <a href="../brand-reputation-improvement-tactics-2019/index.html">brands reputation</a>. During the planning of ads, you have probably done a lot of research and came up with a bunch of keywords that the customers are interested in. But it is impossible to know how well each keyword will help your campaign till you go live.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Additionally, you should not only target customers according to their needs but also have to take into consideration their devices, geographic location and time of the day. Every one of these factors must be researched and analyzed for AdWords campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Ad Copy</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>  If the ads are finally targeting the correct people, it is crucial to consider Ad Copy for optimization purposes. Ad copies have to be carefully written as it will take a lot of effort to come up with the best ad copy and it is a critical part of the Google AdWords campaign. However, your first ad copies probably will not survive for a long time. You will have to continually test new ad copies and try to determine what works best for your Google AdWords campaign. It is essential to monitor the ads performance and decide what is ideal for your customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Landing Pages</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="landing-page" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/KWor9OvWTn5YX2TxaTrqzdv4bZkp8cK3dWvzZJx1SpajQcrt7jdyWmEZlrI_HxwqwkvPaPS_HqPgnwFTY5aqlL-PEuopvUUS0kZ0RywFJXLCO-fGgo8VRjNWw7BVljxzCFJw46Qo" style="height:416px; width:624px"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When a potential customer clicks on the ad, the link will take her directly to your landing page. It is the responsibility of the landing page to convert the consumer into your lead or customer and make a sale. It is vital to mention that the performance of Google AdWords dramatically depends on the design of the landing page. Without a perfectly planned landing page, the two ingredients - ad targeting and ad copy will have no effect, and your efforts for optimizing Google AdWords will not deliver the expected results.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why do I want such a sophisticated plan?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The purpose of numbering these steps is to make sure that you do them in the right order and make sure that you dont miss anything. It is advised to start from ad targeting, then make sure that you have the perfect ad copy up to date and then concentrate on the landing page to make sure that the Google AdWords optimization delivers the best results for your business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will explain all these three steps in detail, but the procedure also has to be tested and optimized to see what works best for you. You have to enhance the process to make sure that you get the maximum return on investment from Google AdWords campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following a checklist is the key to Google AdWords campaign and should not be overlooked. Optimizing Google AdWords is like making a meal. You need the instructions and all the necessary ingredients. The guidelines have to tell you when you should add a particular ingredient, how much you can add, how long you should cook and so on. It is hard the first time you do it because you are not an experienced chef. Therefore, it is vital to have a checklist to make sure that everything goes according to the plan. It works the same way for AdWords optimization. Without it, you can easily mess up the whole optimization process which you cannot afford.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lets dive into each of these processes or as we call it, ingredients to learn in detail what we need to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Ingredient #1. Optimization of Targeting</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Ad targeting may seem to be simple; however, it has a lot of important aspects which must be studied for your AdWords optimization purposes. There are three things you should consider when optimizing your targeting.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Keywords</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bids</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Campaign targeting</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>These three steps will help to reduce your advertising waste. You will have some ads which will not deliver the best results no matter what you do. As we go through these, you will learn how to reduce the waste and reallocate those resources that were being wasted and send them in the right direction. It is important to make sure that your budget is not being wasted, because itll have a considerable impact on the ROI whether it is the<a href="../social-media-marketing-2019/index.html"> cost of social media</a>, Google AdWords or Affiliate marketing terms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By cutting the supply to the ads that arent working and putting more money in whats working will boost your return on investment and AdWords performance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keyword optimization</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="google-adwords-optimization" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/S3SIq9GdFdcjR8ELjst6aNBPqS930h0pR1kmH53NtmA2MsEtufABS46NCHeYyCznDeMFnK-MRkCC_xX1hB8BpGf--_dYM11aW8C_7-5jsrT-BEUwCfOKrW0ixK6l-8a-Aeb-xWZ-" style="height:415px; width:624px"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/03/most-valuable-keywords-high-ctr/index.html">Selecting keywords</a> is one of the most vital targeting factors that you should focus on. Lets imagine that you have the best keyword which your customers are constantly searching for; then you should have a great start on the optimization process for Google AdWords.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nevertheless, you cannot know each single keyword variation which will affect the performance of Google AdWords optimization. Those keywords that look well on paper might not accomplish the expected outcome for the reasons you may never find out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You don't have to get frustrated just because the first keyword list did not work well and was not as profitable as predicted. It takes quite a lot of time and effort to come up with a perfect list of keywords, so take your time to find the best phrases related to your business which is important when it comes to optimizing Google AdWords. We will go through several tactics and strategies to adjust your keyword list once your ads are live.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keyword Pruning</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The purpose of pruning is to remove the keywords that are not relevant or good at generating clicks, but when it comes to sales, they are having a hard time converting the website visitors into leads. You can acquire the data about it in the AdWords account. Go to AdWords account>Keywords>Search terms.</p>
<p>You will get all the required data regarding the exact phrases searched by people while your ad was live. It is easy there to determine which keywords are getting clicks but not conversions. You should remove them from the list as they dont prove to be relevant to your business. Removing them is essential for optimization of Google AdWords. It will cut your waste and help invest the money elsewhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For instance, if you are selling watches for women only, exclude the phrases which have the word mens in it. Because if men are looking for watches for themselves, they will most probably click on the ad but see that you are selling only for women. Thus, they will rarely convert, but you have already paid because they have clicked on that ad. This will dramatically decrease your return on investment and is terrible for Google AdWords optimization. Instead, you should stop spending money on ads that are not productive and use them elsewhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The next thing is to prune by negative keywords</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>You can add negative keywords to the ad group or your campaign to avoid the ads from being shown for particular searches. This will narrow down the consumers and focus on those who have a significantly higher potential of calling you, coming to your business or purchase your product. This step shouldn't be ignored because it is an important tip for optimizing Google AdWords. Heres an example of how negative keywords can help you get a better return on your investment:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lets assume a company is advertising its service under the keyword Lawyer in London to attract new consumers. However, the ad can be displayed if someone is searching for a job as a lawyer. For example, if someone types Job as a lawyer in London your ad will show up to the person, even if he is not looking for the service but a job. Thus, the click will be a waster, and the person will not convert to a customer. He is looking for completely different stuff. It is vital to list keywords such as work or job to narrow down your audience further and achieve better optimization for Google AdWords. This will also help to avoid wasted clicks and become better in your <a href="../digital-marketing-traditional-marketing/index.html">digital marketing </a>endeavors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Negative keywords may be chosen for the ad group level or the whole campaign. The lawyer company shown above can list the terms which are similar in meaning but unrelated to the companys offering as negative keyword thus avoiding waste and achieving better optimization results.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the ad group level, negative keywords can help businesses differentiate their ads and not mix them up to achieve better relevancy on the ads. For example, if a company offers maintenance services for automobiles and puts different ads using Google AdWords, the company can draw a thick line between its ads and differentiate them for the keywords.</p>
<p>If a company is offering maintenance services for trucks only on that particular landing page which is connected to the ad, the company should decide to add negative keywords to avoid getting clicks from people with other types of vehicles for Google AdWords optimization purposes. Or if they are offering maintenance services for gasoline engine vehicles only, they might use negative keywords such as diesel or electric. This way of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanerskine/2018/02/28/6-surprising-ways-to-use-google-adwords-you-havent-tried-yet/#62097ab3366b/index.html">using Google AdWords</a> will get companies more relevancy and more conversions at the same time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Quality Score pruning</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Each of your keywords will be based on several factors including the relevance of the ad, click-through rate, and the visitor behavior once they are at the landing page. The ranking start from the lowest score of 1 up to the highest which is 10. High-quality scores mean your ads are getting the best <a href="../conversion-optimization-small-business-website/index.html">conversion rates</a> for the lowest price. To check the quality scores go to AdWords account>Keywords to see which of your keywords are performing at their highest capacity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You should remove the keywords with scores of three or lower because they are hurting your budget while delivering minimum results. Those keywords are pushing the overall Quality Score down and hindering the ability of the others. If you dont want to delete those low-quality keywords completely, it is recommended to open a separate campaign to test those keywords further without hurting your current campaign. This way you will focus on the quality keywords and see the results of Google AdWords optimization efforts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next thing is to optimize the keywords which are performing between the scores of four and six. Those keywords usually have the potential of performing better and contributing to your Google AdWords optimization efforts. You will be presented with data concerning the ad relevance, the landing page experience, and click-through rate. If you fix the weaknesses of your ad campaign and do Google AdWords optimization, the average Quality Score will increase.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the ad relevance is lower than average, you can try including the keyword to the ad heading. This way people will see that your ad is related to their issues. The people will not click on an ad if they dont think that it might be offering the solution they are looking for.</p>
<p>However, if your landing page scores are below average, you may include the texts of your ads into the landing page content. If people are bouncing off your landing page shortly after they visit, it might be the indication of poor landing page content and Google AdWords optimization. Thus, it is important to indicate at the landing page that they are in the right place for seeking solutions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Cost per conversion pruning</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Creating some benchmarks such as customer lifetime value is essential. Maybe your ads are successfully converting, but it costs you high and make every sale unprofitable. Using the benchmarks, you can get an idea of how much you should invest in acquiring new customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The cost of every conversion has to be calculated if you have set up Google AdWords conversion tracking. If you havent done it yet, pause all of your ads and do it right away. You are merely walking around blind if you havent set up the conversion tracking and you will be unable to finish this essential step of Google AdWords optimization.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once you see that a particular keyword is poorly performing, you can try lowering the bids to see if the profitability increase. If it doesnt, you should probably pause the keyword completely. The keywords that generate a lot of conversions should also be checked to make sure they are optimized as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thats enough cost cutting, lets go fishing!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Keyword fishing</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The purpose of fishing is to find new keywords that look like they can perform well once they go live. You should research the Google search terms report to find promising keywords. You can find and examine a bunch of keywords to add to the list. Those must also be tested to see if they can give the desired results. This takes us to replant keywords optimization tactic.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Keywords replantation</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Replantation is the process of relocating the keywords with the best performance to a separate campaign. This process is a part of Google AdWords optimization and is a way of separating unproven and lower performing keywords from the strong ones, and it offers the following advantages:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Better control of your budget. If all the keywords are in one campaign regardless of their level of performance, you cannot concentrate on the ad spend to the keywords that perform better. Creating a disconnected campaign for the top performing keywords will allow you to invest more money in them and reduce your exposure to the lower performing keywords.</p>
<p>Accurate reporting. When the best keywords are in a single campaign, it will be effortless to recognize trends when looking at the campaign. However, when all the keywords are in a single campaign, poor performing ones will distort your reports and prevent you from spotting trends.</p>
<p>As said earlier, lower performing, poor Quality Score keywords are pushing the scores of other keywords in one campaign. Separating those keywords, optimizing ads and landing pages for them will further increase the overall Quality Scores.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Replanting keywords according to the time of the day or location is also a great idea. It makes sense to open a separate campaign for the state of Texas only if the states people react differently to your ads compared to the other States. It is also possible to have an isolated campaign for the weekends. There might be some keywords that have a better chance of converting during weekends for whatever reason.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now lets step up our game and concentrate on the bids!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Bid Optimization</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The primary goal of optimizing bids is to understand the keyword level bids which can help you increase the conversion rates to the maximum for every keyword. Thus,  efficiently measuring bids is a critical optimization step of Google AdWords. You should have conversion tracking prepared in your Google AdWords account which will allow you to assess conversion rates at the keyword level. Again, if you havent done it already, its advisable that you do it right now and then come back here to proceed. Evaluating conversion rates is a great Google AdWords optimization tool, and itll help you get an idea of how well your ads are doing.</p>
<p><img alt="seo-adwords" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/TbxvFIB0gsXsbqTydlhyNdCMVJL5CTBcr40dWt61frUk2r1Y6Z54vkFjoNdOG4QrGC1mxczodiIug4lULr-QYfoFTRRXVZb5jGX6rvU2cD0epX39YytOg2XHc4uC_ch8hX09x2Um" style="height:416px; width:624px"></p>
<p><br>
 </p>
<p>Since this is an ultimate guide, we should not leave without teaching you some calculations. Math should not scare you or anybody because as you will see it is simple.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First of all, we will need to know how much you can invest in conversion. It hinges upon the customer lifetime value, business and what do you mean by saying a conversion. It might be a sale, phone call, visit the store, registration, etc.</p>
<p>The next thing we need to do is to use AdWords conversion tracking to calculate every keywords conversion rate.</p>
<p>The final step is figuring out the highest cost for each click, which is the most amount of money you can invest in a keyword.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will provide you with an example so you can understand what are we on about:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lets imagine you have decided that you can pay up to 50 dollars for conversion and you have a keyword which has a conversion rate of just 2 percent. To calculate the highest cost per click, we may multiply the maximum amount you are willing to pay by the conversion rate. This will give us the final amount of money you are willing to pay for the particular keyword. So to calculate, we multiply $50 by 2% which will give us $1. This is the maximum amount of money you can pay for the keyword.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are reading this, you are probably new to Google AdWords optimization and dont have the necessary information about the conversion data. But dont worry, because we have thought of people like you. What you need to do is to narrow your focus first by getting rid of the keywords that perform poorly and aggressively bid within your budget. Aggressive bidding will put your ads in primary positions to get the most clicks and give you a better shot at gathering conversion rate data.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After you collect sophisticated information regarding the performance of your keywords, you can go ahead and begin to separate those keywords based on their effectiveness and ROI. This will allow you to dedicate the most significant proportion of your budget there. Your remaining budget can be assigned to do some tests on lower performing keywords.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lets now look at campaign targeting.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Campaign Targeting</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If you have come here, it means you are really into this stuff so I would like to let you know that we are finally done with the keywords, their organization, and the bids. The next thing is to monitor the campaign performance in different geographic locations, at different times of day and the type of device.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Device targeting</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>The performance of ads will differ significantly depending on different devices used by the consumers. Typically, desktop traffic has higher conversion numbers compared to mobile phones. So if you are organizing one campaign for all devices, it means you don't see the bigger picture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For instance, if your ads are performing very well on desktop computers but poorly on mobile devices, the chances are you will see the overall number and consider your campaign unprofitable. If you were to move mobile device targeted ads into another campaign or remove from your list altogether because of their poor performance, your campaign would become profitable right away!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you want to monitor the overall performance of the campaign by a device, go to the Settings section and click on the Device. The page will give all the information about the campaign performance by device. You can play with these functions until you are fully familiar with the indicators, they are providing useful information about Google AdWords optimization.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the reports are showing that all of your mobile targeted keywords are performing poorly, you should turn mobile targeting off and continue with the desktop targeting. However, if you notice that some of your mobile targeted keywords are not doing very bad compared to other mobile targeted keywords, you can move them to another campaign and turn off mobile targeting in the existing one completely.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Geographic targeting</h4>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="geo-targeting" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/JGFI6_MzbBSGE8Hom2HO7Ihy4x8I1m5m8aiYn5xEZEu31fesKS5NH8cWeNC_NJS9vwpQ-PLse6pQkmDQzdf1mCfp1h7qJreX2wmy42ClySStkmVOlAYccLGxz_Qv0fgE-BG3Acks" style="height:416px; width:624px"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To monitor the performance of the campaign by geographical areas, go to Dimensions>View button>Geographic. There you can use Columns option to add or delete columns. The data in this section is quite detailed, so you can go deeper and deeper depending on how precise you want to get.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Time Targeting</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p>It is essential to determine how well the campaign is doing during different times according to Google AdWords optimization experts. They suggest monitoring the difference between specific hours of the day or different days of the week. For instance, restaurants who deliver meals can have more conversion rates right before dinner time than later in the evening. So restaurants would bid aggressively during lunch and dinner times, and minimize bids during other hours. To get the data about the performance by day or time, go to Dimensions>View button>Time and then choose the hour of day or day of the week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you see that the bids need adjustments because they perform significantly better and increase conversion rates, you should restrain the bids during unproductive hours by going to Settings>Ad scheduling. After we have finished ad targeting and are confident that the ads will be aggressively put during the selected hours, we can move on to the next step which is the ad copy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Ingredient #2. Optimizing The Ad Copy</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In this step, we are going to presume that the ads are arranged into different ad groups so that every keyword inside the ad group is matched to the ad copy. Also, we are going to assume that you have successfully narrowed down your target audience and are left with the ideal consumers. You have already selected the times, locations and devices according to your needs for the optimization purposes.</p>
<p>If you havent completed all the steps above, you should stop right here and go back up to finish all the steps and come back here once you are done. The perfect ad copy on the whole planet can fail if you have made your ad go live at the wrong place at the wrong time. Thus, it is vital that you complete the mentioned steps for the sake of Google AdWords Optimization and not worry about failing. Once you fail, you will learn valuable<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/business/smallbusiness/15adwords.html"> Google AdWords lessons</a> which you will need in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a process called split testing in optimizing the ad copy. It consists of testing distinctive ad variations to determine what works best, what doesnt. It is a process of enhancing your ad copy and is a crucial step of Google AdWords optimization.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For instance, if you decide to create two different ad copies and show them to the people. You should show one of them to 50% of the audience, and the remaining 50% should see the second ad copy. Over time you will gather a piece of sophisticated information regarding the performance of each ad copy, for example, the conversion or click-through rates. You might then decide to disable one of them and continue with the other one for optimization purposes. There are five main things you should concentrate on when creating the ad copy:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What you offer</p>
<p>The headline</p>
<p>The Description lines</p>
<p>Display URL</p>
<p>Ad Extensions</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The offer</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>You should create an ad copy which will stand out among the ads of the competitors and bring more traffic and conversions. It has to grab the attention of the customer, so they cannot resist clicking on the ad and possibly purchasing your products or services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many businesses make a mistake of overlooking this part of Google AdWords optimization. They make regular ads with regular offers which do not shine in the eyes of the customers. However, you should never overdo it. Putting too much information on your ad can have negative results and do more harm than good. Therefore, it is essential to keep it brief and simple.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An important thing to note is that the average Quality Score is affected by the click-through rate. It means that if your competitors click-through rates are higher than yours, then you are going to have a hard time getting the Quality Score high and making a decent profit. Having a lot of competitors also means that you have to bid or pay more for the top placement.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is crucial to building compelling ad copies and make sure they get maximum attention. Once your ads are terrific, you should be able to compete with the others and afford to pay more for the top placement because the click-through and conversion rates will be high getting you a better return on investment. Thus, it is vital to consider your offer carefully for Google AdWords optimization.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you have just started optimizing the process for Google AdWords, you can look at your competitors ads and have an idea of what it is like to create one. They are already using the keywords that you are planning to utilize, and it would make sense to learn from them as they have probably been into this for some time. You should remember that you have to come up with a greater ad. Otherwise, people will click on the competitors ads instead of yours.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What can I offer that will differentiate me from my competitors?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Free Samples - If you have just started the business and dont have a lot of customers, you can bring traffic to your website or business by offering free samples or demos of your products or services. This way people will have a chance to get to know you or your company well and try your products or services to determine whether it is something worth of value or not. Once you get the momentum of customers flowing in your direction, you can then transform free samples and trials into actual sales and make a profit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Special Discounts</em> - Everyone knows what a discount is and you can grab peoples attention by offering a little bit lower prices. However, you should be cautious if you choose to do so because you might lose money in the process and even risk going bankrupt when you are offering lower than the minimum market price.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Guarantee Your Products</em> - If you are guaranteeing your product, the people will have more trust in the business, and it will considerably improve the chances of them doing business with you. Money back guarantees will assure the consumers that you are confident in your product and willing to pay customers back if they arent satisfied with it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Free Gifts </em>- Everyone adores free stuff, who doesnt? So offer your customers gifts if they choose to purchase a product or service. You might also exploit discount offers such as 1+1. This way, the customers will be getting two identical products for the price of one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now lets look at the Ad and see what it is going to look like</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Headline</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The headline is the first that people read right after they click on the Search button. Now there are two main goals. First, you should be certain that the headline is one hundred percent relevant. The second thing is to stand out from the crowd. Therefore, you need to be a little creative to come up with unique headlines.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Description Lines</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>In this section, you need to explain what your business offers. It has to be plain and simple.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Ingredient #3. Landing page optimization</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>And the final ingredient! Dont worry; this is the last and the shortest section of this post. Here I will briefly explain what it takes to enhance the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page/index.html">landing page</a> for Google AdWords optimization purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are going to assume again that you have successfully completed all the optimization steps mentioned above and you will get the maximum click-through rates. However, the landing page also has to be optimized because it is a job of a landing page to convert website visitors into leads or sales.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note: You should never use the homepage as a landing page. Home pages usually provide a general idea about the business. However, you need a webpage which will tell the customer the same thing the ad told her. Website visitors have to be certain that she has come to the right place. Thus, you should definitely create a landing page and optimize it simultaneously with the ad. If you happen to have different ad copies for different products or services, you should consider creating separate landing pages which will be optimized around the ads.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How to build a landing page and what does it take?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><em>The Headline</em> - The headline of a landing page is a vital optimization step which does not have to be overlooked. It is vital that the headline matches the contents of the ad. After all, the contents of the ad are the main reason why the website visitor came to your site, right? Thus, it is essential to keep them highly related, so the visitor does not bounce back killing the conversion rates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Focus on Benefits</em> - the landing page should demonstrate what kind of benefits business partners get from buying your services or products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Social Proof </em>- Many people are hesitating to take and action and purchase something if they have just found out about your site. They might need recommendations from other people to make sure that you offer quality products and the best customer experience. Therefore, it is important to put some testimonials on the landing pages. Also, you can try <a href="../guide-social-media-marketing-2019/index.html">social media marketing</a> and connect with the customers to build trust via social media websites.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Navigation </em>- Once a website visitor has landed on your site, it is essential to show her what she has to be doing next. It can either be a telephone number saying she can call and ask for help or initiate the process of converting the visitor into an actual customer.</p>

 </p>
<h3>Set a clear goal</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the critical things to consider while starting to the AdWords campaign is having a clear and specific purpose. While doing so, you will improve the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp/index.html">return on investment</a> of the AdWords campaign, grow the sales and create brand awareness. Set the goal ahead and run a successful AdWords campaign.</p>
<p><br>
 </p>
<h3>Know the target audience</h3>
<p><img alt="target-audience" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/V3gYhwTzpkHSdbBm9P2udIQY8X5n77F4vRfemEbrP2WyxHMblAPuQyqF7QYeJ1sw7iUOwWfORXiq-Ypi7t7gwEl0_4Txjk4gjWEilx4WxuUoXMQ4tuavaIkbLsgdomzbszzrQ1jr" style="height:416px; width:624px"></p>
<p>Invest your time and resources to understand the target audience. You need to make sure that the ads will draw the attention of the audience and convince the customers that they need these services and products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Setting a goal and knowing your target audience will help to lead the customers to perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)/index.html">Call-to-Action</a> and get the satisfaction hopefully. With targeting the right audience, you assure that the ads will draw attention with the right context and tone, increase customer interest and drive your customers to take action.

<h3>Set the AdWords budget</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="adwords-budget" src="../../lh5.googleusercontent.com/IPrw_PC_z2HRUDmead7XlqOiETPl8MgmjMAe8HFrxQ-NgpgnaqERFu468QxmTEHqDjOMcZ_K3RDU9-SSxA2Q1ajetRYPShcxF-NNIRVqlHjA0k_ZOdyepc1SGOKlF15Rx2VJ8eLM" style="height:416px; width:624px"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the best AdWords campaign tips is setting the budget per campaign. You should set the budget for each campaign, as this will not make the work complicated among the multiple ads. Determine how much money you need to spend each AdWords campaign monthly, weekly and daily. Set the AdWords budget and do not stay with an empty bank account.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Avoid misleading customers</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>It is recommended not to mislead the customers. Set the ads relevantly for each ad group and display significant queries. Try to provide full information about the services and products, be specific and avoid mistreating your customers. Make sure you run the AdWords campaign correctly and engage with the visitors directly and honestly.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Set the AdWords campaign by device</h3>
<p> </p>

With structuring campaigns by devices, you can set bids and track the results separately. Set the campaign by the device and control the return of investment completely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the next paragraphs, you can learn about tracking and testing your progress, the importance of choosing the right campaign type and much more.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Use negative keywords</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As we mentioned above negative keywords allow you to eliminate the search terms from your campaign so that you can focus on the keywords which matter more to the customers. You can escalate the ROI by improved targeting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because it has different types of AdWords campaigns, it targets various types of negative keywords. They work differently for every campaign type. For instance, if you are running a Display campaign, negative keywords will be excluded as an exact topic. One of our essential AdWords campaign tips is using negative keywords because selecting what not to target is necessary to run a successful campaign. Targeting negative keywords will help to streamline the ads. This will improve the Google AdWords Quality Score and drive more <a href="../get-juicy-SEO-traffic-gaming-site/index.html">traffic to the website</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Track and test accurately</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>While the AdWord campaign is running, you have to make constant adjustments. Any small improvement in the landing pages, keywords, knowing what works for the campaign and what doesnt is the key to seeing the big difference in the long term.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the AdWord campaign tips is testing and tracking accurately. Once you have determined the marketing goal, plan several tests to escalate the outcome. Start from identifying the keywords to bid on, <a href="../landing-page-guidelines/index.html">landing page</a> design, email marketing campaigns and create variations of ads, check which one is getting the best click, the lowest CPC, the highest conversion rate and triggering a sale.</p>
<p>After learning the best ads, keep them to lift Return on Investment (RIO) and remove the keywords which are not generating the returns. If you are not adequately tracking, you can not expect to promote the ads successfully. Test and follow various bid strategies, keywords and ads to find the best choice to reach the CPA goals. As you run the AdWords campaign, you will get successful results from tracking the keywords and ads producing many leads.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><br>
Determine a bid strategy</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="bid-strategy" src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/88kFXdbcxjrn6-Vxa4Db7Ry6sE77k8YDWXmeZALUGztrsF7dwXTATkpPtO8tt8w6EsUNxtNfT--OyZmzVwxQv6pQU1X1MuWynSM3hREeOTQ54RnRocKd_niJXkraQG7UuIxq_O6E" style="height:439px; width:624px"></p>
