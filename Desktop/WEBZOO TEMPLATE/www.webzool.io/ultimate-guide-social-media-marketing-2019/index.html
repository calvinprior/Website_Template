Pros of social media make marketers choose this platform. What will we do for being successful in <a href="../social-media-marketing-2019/index.html">Social Media Marketing</a> in 2019? You will find answers to this question in the article.</p>

<p>- Social Media tools which will assist you</p>
<p>- How to take benefit from social media accounts for personal branding</p>
<p>- How to improve abilities for managing Social Media.</p>
<p>So, let's begin.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Your Social Media Marketing Strategy for 2019</h2>
<p>If you want to carry out social media marketing well, you need a good strategy.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, you can post on social media accounts and even create social media campaigns without a strategy. However, the strategy will help you to understand your goals, to determine the target audience and their demands.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, if you want to develop the brand via social media and to level up as a marketer, then you will have to create a <a href="../digital-marketing-traditional-marketing/index.html">digital marketing</a> strategy.</p>
<h3>Preparation of Social Media Marketing Strategy</h3>
<p>Its interesting to note that a social media marketing strategy and plan have many crossovers.</p>
<p>Some people cannot identify the social media marketing strategy and plan because they possess many crossovers. You have a goal, and you know where you want to get - it is your STRATEGY. You think and prepare a program on how to get the goal - it is your PLAN.</p>
<p>Before creating a strategy, it is better to take some notes for ourselves like:</p>
<p>- Reasons for being on social media;</p>
<p>- Detecting of the target audience;</p>
<p>- Posts that you will share;</p>
<p>- Relevant platform for your posts;</p>
<p>- The time for sharing posts.</p>
<p>You can design your social media marketing strategy in common, or you may create separate strategies (for example Instagram marketing strategy, Facebook marketing strategy, and so on).</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for being on social media</strong> - It depends on your social media goals. Do you want to promote your brands on social media platforms? Do you aim to <a href="../get-juicy-SEO-traffic-gaming-site/index.html">get traffic for your website</a>? Or do you want to serve your customers via social media?</p>
<p>There are many social media goals that you can possess:</p>
<p>1) Improve brand awareness; 2) Drive traffic to the site; 3) Make new leads; 4) Increase income (by extending sales or signups); 5) Raise brand engagement; 6) Arrange a community around your field; 7) Implement social customer service; 8) Boost mentions in the media; 9) Check the feedbacks about your brand or service.</p>
<p>It is better to have more than one social media purpose, and thats nice. In general, its good to focus on just some of the goals unless you have a company, where different people within the group can take on several missions.</p>
<p><strong>Detecting of the target audience </strong>- If you have figured out the reasons, the next point to think is the target audience. Knowing your target audience will benefit you more quickly answer the following issues that posts, and appropriate platform for these posts. For example, a travel and lifestyle brand knows that its target audience enjoys reading about travel tips and new places. It is better to post such content on their social media profiles.</p>
<p>An excellent exercise to test here is to create marketing personas. There are many various methods of building marketing personas. One of these ways is to use specific questions.</p>
<p>Who is the audience? (E.g. gender, age,  salary, job title, location, etc.)</p>
<p>What is the audience interested in that you can give? (educational content, entertainment,  case studies, information on new products, etc.)</p>
<p>Where does the audience usually hang out online? (Instagram, Facebook, etc. or niche platforms)</p>
<p>When do they search for the kind of content you can provide? (during the daily commute, weekends,  etc.)</p>
<p>Why does the audience use the content? (to become healthy, to get better at the job,  to stay available with something, etc.)</p>
<p>How do they consume the content? (read social media posts, watch video contents, etc.)</p>
<p>It is not necessary to begin from scratch. If the business has been running for a while, probably, you already have a good sense of the target audience. What might be important is to address it down so that you can practice for the future reference or share it with the stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Posts that you will share</strong> - When you see this phrase, you might be considering the types of content to share. For instance, do you want to share images or videos?</p>
<p>We are speaking about the social media marketing strategy and lets take a step back in order to think on a higher level. Actually, theme may be a better word, instead of the sorts of content to share. Let's see some brands and their themes:</p>
<p><strong>An adventure and outdoor brand</strong> - Huckberry posts high-quality photos and their editorial content of the outdoors on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Huckberry/index.html">Facebook profile</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="huckberry-instagram-post" src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/FwX-uYREI-d_wf_33HgHHaYb9rRWGrIEcFeKIcqayYKoMtxDFLji6bWOylZPuOZRQx-37kYFRl_tan0eaMhBqRFjlxC-BZMTu-kCn12e3SOYKzMf3d0Z2YXnU98TTNLnA_mod3gY" style="height:524px; width:665px"></p>
<p>Burrow - it is a luxury couch brand and often shares memes on the <a href="https://instagram.com/p/Bsf6NekDjx4/index.html">Instagram page</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="mind-body-problem" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/5s2clmhf_PEzL1x2OUyS8zxuhVzFIuPeVrxKoTuckq8jhy8fmk5UkNY1GZNe4zcrthtSEayWoV156j2N0WFrtebMn1DOnGRm5OzYxFAUr9QA4j2_FE5LJI-eoojJLNDseFE1lzeJ" style="height:381px; width:665px"></p>
<p>MeUndies is a popular underwear brand. You can see that they share photos from their clients and pictures of customers' products on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsvf7jJlLR2/index.html">Instagram profile</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/sIBRmNDS8aXy38l1YTSF_Wc556DqrnS0__1Ww8MdWPi_jDBBglUj9uRzLuAl24Vcut0JnTSj-aJs3om1YWlAZskAdBggwX8OLBLWsZJkxQx4Xfw3fpFeUiP8hKZmpqusu-Ox6U03" style="height:474px; width:665px"></p>
<p>When you look through the social media profiles like we named above, you may notice that the brands possess more than one theme. If you have many themes for social media profile, it is perfectly fine as it gives you more opportunities for context. You have enough place to post a content range to retain the audience engaged without being unfocused. Remember that, it will help you to understand your target audience. Review the marketing personas and find answers the following questions: What purposes and challenges does your audience have? What can you do to help them solve their problems?</p>
<p>For instance, fitness clothes and accessories brand, an intention of their target audience may be to stay up-to-date with the latest fitness equipment. In this case, their social media profile can share its most recent goods. By the way, regarding the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/22/instagram-ahead-of-snapchat-in-popularity-among-teens-piper-jaffray.html">survey of Investment bank</a>, Piper Jaffray among the 8,600 American teens, most respondents (more than 70%) preferred brands to communicate them about new products via Instagram. It proves again that understanding your target audience is essential.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant platform for your posts</strong> - The following step is to decide where we are going to share the content. In other words, which social media platforms are suitable for the brand.</p>
<p>Before it, we must emphasize that your brand doesnt have to exist on each social media platforms. Many brands did it before, and the results were not sufficient. Being on some platforms gives you more time to create better content and a better focus on it.</p>
<p>P.S. There is a thought that it will be good to at least have an official profile on the Big Four social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Because, when people search for your brand these websites have more chances to appear on the <a href="../key-steps-rise-top-search-results-google-search/index.html">first page of the search results</a>.</p>
<p>Again and again, the understanding of your target audience will help you here. On which social media platforms are your target audience most available? What affects them to visit those platforms? For instance, when young adults and teens are bored, they would like to scroll through Instagram to see what their friends, relatives are doing or if their beloved brands have new something. There is another small issue that we should take into account:</p>
<p>What is the "X factor" of your brand? Maybe you are great at writing or photography and videos. Each platform allows itself well to specific content type. For instance, articles are perfect on Medium, photo, and images on Instagram, and videos on YouTube. However, it is not a vital point because now, social media sites are developing to contribute almost all types of contents. Also, consider not big, niche platforms, too.</p>
<p><strong>The time for sharing posts</strong> - The crucial last part of your strategy is solving when you have to share your content. Maybe you have searched it before and have some opinions.</p>
<p>Take a step back and watch this from a higher level again. Analyze the behaviors of your target audience before selecting precisely which time of the day and day of the week you will share the content. The essential point is to know when your audience uses their social media accounts. It is vital for Social Media Marketing. These examples will help you to consider:</p>
<p>Sports fans usually, enter social media just before, during, and after sports events to see and interact with content about their sport.</p>
<p>Athletes perhaps on Instagram while they are cooling down after their morning exercise or evening workouts.</p>
<p>Travel addicted people might be more available on social media during the weekends, Because they are preparing for their next trip in weekends (or during their lunch breaks when they are thinking about their upcoming journey).</p>
<p>Possibly, mothers of infants scroll through social media platforms when they breastfeed their kids in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Maybe these examples made you a little confused because of not having a general time to share. However, it depends on each audience. That's why it is essential to focus on the behaviors of the target audience. Creating the social media marketing strategy will assist you in finding the best time for sharing the posts.</p>
<h2>Implementation of Social Media Marketing Strategy</h2>
<p>Now you have a strategy for your Social Media Marketing. However, thats not the end. As we emphasized above, a strategy is where you want to get; a plan is how you can get there. You have decided your strategy; now you can prepare a plan. As a social media marketer, you have to fill out social media profiles correctly. This process includes useful contents, as well as links, images or videos.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step guide that might be helpful for you. Follow these steps and increase your social media level:</p>
<p>1) Selecting social networks;</p>
<p>2)Setting up the profiles completely;</p>
<p>3) Pinpoint your tone and voice;</p>
<p>4) Pick the posting strategy;</p>
<p>5) Analyze your profiles and test them;</p>
<p>6) Engage and automate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Creating a social media marketing strategy is apparently one of the hardest tasks to do. This process needs you to step back and watch at the large image. You have to turn the mindset away from your daily jobs like to respond to comments to higher-level thinking and to schedule. However, having a strategy is helpful and hugely rewarding. It will support you get your whole business and social media goals.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Do not leave out trends</h2>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/I-BTmJAxXrxAfYlIzysE5pLTQcRxcvVaCMk_OiA0-mp8PuD6eow4hY5gSZhsi50bjBvFVw7hc6VDYUSourIfh_s14kb7_pFJpXqG4bN_ppyqmUFf7c1sz5b0xCMSb8FcG0-FjEkB" style="height:498px; width:665px"></p>
<p>As a social media marketer, we have to follow two main factors: 1) Technology; 2) News. Social media is always moving, so it is essential to be ready for all changes and trends. How can we keep step with trends in 2019? Let's discuss it:</p>
<p>Social media audience of the brand will need to get a more human side to the business in the following year (especially, if your business is small or medium-size).</p>
<p>If you have any doubts about this, then you can take a look at how so great business owners make personal experiences, currently.</p>
<p>As a diligent business owner in 2019, you should focus on to develop your private brand. The main factor is to get a personal touch to your brand. In other words, a business owner must communicate with its audience on a personal level. Be active on social media. Make sure that the co-workers in your company are increasing the voice that your audience needs and relate independently.</p>
<h2>Use videos frequently</h2>
<p>Videos become favorite day after day. More people will prefer to watch video contents than to read text posts. And it stands to reason that you should develop your video marketing strategy.</p>
<p>However, why do people like videos? Videos are bright and vibrant. You will make a little effort to get started and create high-quality content. Technology (smartphones, cameras) contributes us to create qualitative videos. Here are two hints for your video contents on social media:</p>
<p>1) Try to tell exciting stories in the videos.</p>
<p>It is an essential point, and your audience must follow the content. This "addiction" will keep your videos alive. Improve your storytelling abilities, and you will see that the videos will promptly get success.</p>
<p>2) Use subtitles for your videos.</p>
<p>It makes the content more coherent for beholders. Moreover, subtitles help to understand the topic without a voice. It really works when people are at work, or in transport.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/natgeo/?hl=en/index.html">National Geographic</a> applies these hints within their Instagram Stories. We strongly recommend this method.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Money, money, money</h3>
<p>If you are in the business field, you will probably face with this approach. You will see that paid marketing takes a big part in the overall strategy. Advertising will remain to increase in importance. Honestly, it is just not enough to count on organic reach or engagement. Allocate a sensible part of your budget to paid advertisement and marketing. It includes <a href="../increasing-significancy-content-marketing/index.html">boosted content</a> and sponsored posts. While it costs money, you don't have to begin with a significant spend.</p>
<p>The better choice is to start small, and then continue to experiment with the results. As you increase in engagement, designate the money at the paid chances that work. In other words, spend the money, but be careful. If you cleverly examine all the paid advertisements you use, you shouldnt be in a position where you accomplish wasting budget for too long. Advertising does work; however, it only works if youve done to do it efficiently.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Of course, engagement...</h3>
<p>When everything was wrong on Facebook in early 2018, it became visible that even that company had realized that you should carefully manage engagement needs. While the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/facebook-security-breach-details.html">datum breach</a> probably had nothing directly to do with engagement, it did make Facebook more cautious about its privacy. It also said that it tried users to notice stuff on Facebook that was important and relevant to them.</p>
<p>Take responsibility for the situation in 2019 and practice your social media channels as chances to connect in a meaningful way. This kind of honest engagement, quality, and paired with a sensible paid approach, will make social media marketing much more comfortable to manage in 2019 and next years.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>From macro to micro-influencer</h3>
<p>The Influencer vocation became prominent after 2010, and no one can deny its contribution to Social Media Marketing. Nevertheless, last year this phenomenon has begun to diminish a little because great roles in the field are getting too pricy. In addition, some of them lose their attractiveness as a business partner. Current investigations of social media marketing determine that micro-influencers will be a trend in 2019. In other words, marketers will prefer micro-influencers to macro-influencers in the following years.</p>
<p>Compare with other partners micro-influencers have much fewer audiences. Usually, their followers are about 10-50K. But, the point is that these audiences are always highly engaged. From this point of view, you can get worth data and provide ads to this kind of audience. Cooperating with micro-influencers will save you money. And their audience is better and apparent than great Influencers. Hence, experts suppose that micro-influencers will be more successful in 2019.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Never annoy your audience with social media posts</h2>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/foImgT9ilwJew5C8tpyaugiHb9XkgoVYoeJuf7QMNOr2gyBc7PrKd_2lCQoK4qxNCsnhqynFhuokusDrElewcEDx3FEUd1jxIqJSv0nCTKfwpeuVHhxptAeL3l8QLmoyJCqJzH2B" style="height:600px; width:600px"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Probably, you have seen some wrong posts on Facebook or unreasonable auto-replies from pages. And it is also undeniable that social media profiles influence profoundly to the audience. That's why it is essential to avoid bad social media marketing. Bad social media marketing can hurt your company reputation and hugely damage the business in the process.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>No excuses, no non-apologises</h3>
<p>Run away from corporate non-apologies on social media accounts. Be sure that followers don't like it at all. It is better to send a real, natural apology from your heart. Additionally, do not make excuses, it works neither in real life nor on social media :) If something is wrong simply admit the fault, acknowledge the audience's feeling and promise to correct the mistakes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Handling auto replies manually</h2>
<p>Another problematic point is wrong auto-replies. Presume that banks are suggesting technical support to protestors or airline social media accounts sending general "thank you" responses to canceled flights. So to run away from this nonsense you need to check all auto replies manually. This adjustment helps you to personalize your replies or give relevant answers that your audience will really enjoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Moderate the emojis</h3>
<p>Social media marketers frequently use emojis because of their engagement effect. Emojis help the brand look more natural, deliver the feelings. Make sure, that your social media accounts are friendly with your followers. And use emojis in moderation.</p>
<p>Because using too many emojis makes posts look spammy and destroys your brands (product, service) professionalism. As a rule, we recommend you to use a maximum of 2 emojis per social media posts. It sounds more friendly and straightforward. Also, it gives you the chance of being in-touch while retaining professionalism.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Stop using engagement baits</h2>
<p>Facebook administration actively demoted <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/news-feed-fyi-fighting-engagement-bait-on-facebook/index.html">engagement baits</a>. Why? Because users do not desire to see these contents. Pages force followers to comment or share their posts. Engagement baits provide no real value for users and the primary purpose of it to create fake engagements. As a result, engagement baits will annoy the audience, make a bad face for the brand on social media, and it is hazardous for professional reputation.</p>
<p>Although Facebook investigates these posts, it is still widespread on brand pages. But we strongly recommend you to avoid engagement baits for being natural.</p>
<h2>Watch out when cross-posting on social media accounts</h2>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/SZv1Tm4kePzYGvClre_Wb3yzt5C0LOBrCpRnnD3ja1kMaZ7ARVp0oJ4xkPkJ8DGROjDlpvBHMCh5dihJ-LwjILk278ExVq5QOlLZYj2ZoHqd3Jqod6g7YPs8RpseUaRTn6FkDfyB" style="height:488px; width:665px"></p>
<p>Usually, the audience of your brand follows you on different social networks. For instance, your fan firstly likes your facebook page, then follows you on Twitter and on Instagram.</p>
<p>Regarding this action, we recommend you do not automatically cross-post each social media post to all of the social networks at once. It may annoy the audience who follows you on every social account. They may think about you that you are not original.</p>
<p>It is better to create different social content for each network and to post identical content at different times on every social account. For instance, in the following links, you can see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/TheCocaColaCo/posts/?ref=page_internal/index.html">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cocacola/index.html">Instagram posts</a> of the Coca-Cola Company. You can do this by using content group features and social media posting schedules. These features will assist you in automating your posts at different times. It is like a high-quality autopilot regime on social media accounts.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Use humor but dont look the opposite of cool</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/dexh8xhcJGnWFhTeZatkM4ODyvTRg_tqNqNTF1oRZ9LzsqLsexIMLiHOOldr42_z__O4B4JLiGaUnatPqRqkMRHRZkD6B74SA-OqLjr6U3-9MoYSaM8LJ2zOsn72pHwFLpgW8OFE" style="height:380px; width:665px"></p>
<p>Sounding "hip" and humor are perfect, and it is better to use them when you have the possibility. But, we should underline that do not force yourself to use wit: It will only make the brand seem not cool. So if you can use humor on social media posts, it will do a significant interaction. However, we should admit that not all of us have this skill.</p>
<p>Keep the inconveniences which we mentioned above. Because misusing these six issues on your social media accounts can cause some problems, like hurting your engagement, destroying your reputation and decreasing your brand's professionalism.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How Social Media Managers can save their time</h2>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/DfbocLiOAz7HUqEuK426eH5mpKOYOIvuqGxH0-LRMeNCvs6YoUbPUGbqVhGMNh9eKDIMNgh8ifqtf7KHv3wEEzs7rxbmc1gV6bM-owCA6YBtIDhrR4mLKipZVeMiInTKvPPxV4Mj" style="height:379px; width:665px"></p>
<p>Time is a treasure that we all need it. Unfortunately, there are no market or service which sell it. We can't buy time but, we always can save it. Below, we will show how you can avoid waste your time and be more prolific as a social media manager. These tactics will help you to schedule your posts and to complete them quickly.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Friday is the best day to design your calendar</h2>
<p>Some social media managers take their content day after day. But, we do not recommend it. It is better to come up with your weekly content calendar each Friday before going to the weekend. Don't worry, it is not an obligation to write all the details of your content, but it is good to get a schedule from Monday to Tuesday and develop it. You can include in the table what and when to post, new ideas, etc. This action assures you to share the social media posts on-time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Make a to-do list paper</h3>
<p>Download a reminder app and take your laptop. Adjusting a to-do list everyday paper will influence your time positively and will make you more productive. Actually, it is a pretty basic rule, but it really works. Usually, it is better to use to-do list on your notebook, or paper. Because smartphones or tablets can distract you. However, it is not a rule. Some people can work effectively with these gadgets. You know yourself better than others. So check all devices and determine your choice.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Avoid distraction and apply a site blocker</h3>
<p>If you are a social media manager, it is effortless to get distracted on the topic of distractions.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as a social media manager, the character of our work is to create content which other people will find interesting. Unfortunately, it is possibly accessible to go phut of mindless web browsing while you always look for interesting content to post.</p>
<p>Therefore, investing in a good site blocking app for the computer is more recommended. You can use the app to block unnecessary social networks, distracting sites or other things that you think may be a hinder during your activity. We should underline that many apps like this cannot be disabled upon the demand. It means that you will be constrained to do your job instead of playing online games.</p>
<p>People usually choose site blocking apps Focused for Mac or FocusMe for PC. But, you may select another app in accordance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Create evergreen content and repost it</h3>
<p>Now it is time to focus the efforts on making contents that have a long shelf life. Create long-form blog posts, interesting infographics, and white papers. It is useful because you can repost it. Let us clarify our mind.</p>
<p>For instance, if you create an infographic, you will be able to reshare it with the audience as many times as you wish. It will help you to have a stock of high-quality contents.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Use light-weight design apps</h2>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/Esh85B0h7DcMlUIYFOCVhfKBEx8-ZtqX1nwqrTVhLEMgCMJNVr7rnBYhW-lbCSZvMZvoyUALuQSmo-qvYXKOZY8oLUTCxd-6gnPczLOKlXacHi2h57NyyqmPY4uM9C-_VxL2xhkS" style="height:447px; width:447px"></p>
<p>Social media managers usually forced to edit or create many images for their social channels. There are some professional design programs like Illustrator or Photoshop. However, these tools are essential for professional designers, and you can use Canva or another light-weight program instead of them.</p>
<p>These apps will accelerate the workflow as they allow users to create original social media designs from templates. Their interfaces are user-friendly, and you can make a banner (or poster) in a few minutes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Determine useful apps for creating content ideas</h2>
<p>Sometimes you can hardly find new ideas for contents. But don't panic, it is normal because you work with thousands of materials and creating a new idea is not always easy. In this case, you can use content curation apps like Buzzsumo to find new topics and unique contents that you can post on social media channels.</p>
<p>Using these apps is not difficult. First, you search for a topic and the app provides you with a list of necessary articles related to your keyword. When you have selected some interesting ideas, you can make your content easily.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Pay attention to automation</h2>
<p>Nowadays automation is like a fantastic method to speed up our social media marketing. Frankly speaking, a robot working instead of us may seem impressive. Posting from an RSS feed, reposting automatically Evergreen content, and other kinds of automation can help us to save our time when used precisely.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it can be an entire waste of time in some cases. For instance, automating direct messages and support requests can fail hard. Imagine that your auto-reply system replies with "thank you!" message to a dissatisfied user. It means that you have already destroyed your valuable reputation with that user, but you also have to apologize and do the right things. As a result, automation has two opposite side about time-saving. So watch out lightly when you automate the work.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Essential Social Media Scheduling Tools for you</h2>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/X-HZ5iDJBICIkyr2Bve_mrw14Umgyx-nrTupwIB5FbcM6ps8LVmSxv7qkGa5dzlA0VUrTERobyHHACNsDy4_EYvu5BPLxdaJAsCZ4Xbmbz9CrpMamhoz5LmfMMPIecje3R80rFZn" style="height:426px; width:665px"></p>
<p>As we emphasized above social media managers always need more time. Social media marketing is a complex field, and it is essential to be aware of content creation, <a href="../web-design/index.html">graphic design</a> or media analyze in this sector. Therefore, we always recommend social media managers to use tools. To work productively on social media, you must determine your app (tool). You know that there are many different social media tools available, so we detected 9 of them which are popular nowadays. We will discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the tools.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Social media scheduling tool-1: MeetEdgar</h3>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/YHrqdF39BaSBCYXSUOlaE1ktT1HKszny6l4YX-5mn99xH5HLfR-fqYKy2JWf7d8DOGS0ZyvhIQreO3VoY8oSpAZBI-KimmRnrXJL9xZk_u9DtfAWd2kT9h1H2GNPkrmknOR0E14n" style="height:423px; width:593px"></p>
<p>MeetEdgar is a perfect social media scheduling application that you can use. You can adjust your social media schedules on Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, and Instagram via MeetEdgar.</p>
<p>Firstly, we assign a category when we schedule posts in this tool. Then, these appointed categories sort the self-scheduling content calendar. The program mixes all categories for interesting social feed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the feature set of MeetEdgar is limited. We will not see reporting tools or scheduling to Instagram is incapable. Furthermore, creating separate employee accounts is not available in this application.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Social media scheduling tool-2: Buffer<img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/XVfA-eSM90YivMLYNiId8_KPtZfXG3F3Vd76F0A_sFtTiPb-YYo64CWeLaDD_sYjsuE6nmzq9jNJ5YuoG1V_d5OZ6DiTgxuJpFPit0baSWY928Ldr1iiCdjXSmXeDVP_TfEO_ksG" style="height:423px; width:593px"></h3>
<p>Buffer is prominent all over the world, and it is estimated as a vital tool in social media marketing. This program supports scheduling your content to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Pinterest which we usually call "big five" social network channels.</p>
<p>But this program can not work with other smaller social media channels. Moreover, Buffer does not possess an official reporting tool. If you are a Buffer user, you should log in for early access to Buffer Analyze. However, it has a few openly available details. Therefore, it is difficult to come about if this tool works correctly.</p>
<p>To sum up, Buffer is a good social media tool and can be a good choice. However, it can't get into new social media channels and make qualitative reports to your customers and managers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Social media scheduling tool-3: ViralTag</h3>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/XksdJLOFLwFr0o5feQWTXFVeV-KL0m0riywiwph4nQErDhX6Hn59-F4rAvkEOiDA_6oDyGu1jS4cgcLJ8tBt0iPQ5jqV-kixdiCXPlArr51-irC_0b5hC9AMaAuKPprJ_2SrtcPB" style="height:423px; width:593px"></p>
<p>ViralTag is a social media tool that provides a unique and visual-first approach to scheduling. The advantage of this program is that we can move it around the visual calendar to change the time or edit images by using the built-in image editor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The main disadvantage of ViralTag is about Instagram scheduling. Unfortunately, it doesn't have direct Instagram scheduling. We can schedule our posts in this tool, but we have to achieve all Instagram photos and videos via the ViralTag mobile application. So, if you are planning to work with ViralTag, consider that you will have some hardships about Instagram, which is the most growing social media in the world. We have already talked about it at the beginning of our article.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Social media scheduling tool-4: Loomly</h3>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/BeDtVoGWCUQAytz1VXTJ0QSUKMNYAB6aX1mV4GhZ0N_elmknAgOw0AZMtYP4QIizNS75RVmnzHCXyxKFEaDIzQRolqRHRqffvI9hqqpixfo2NLHjITvftdiZJ7E0O0bJYlS28E10" style="height:423px; width:593px"></p>
<p>Maybe some people didn't hear this name before, because Loomy is a new program and has exciting features. Loomy possesses everything for social media marketing. We can post, schedule our calendar and analyze the social media accounts by using Loomy. Features, such as smart post idea generator, content calendar creator and customizable post previews are other pros of Loomy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This program has difficulties with support for <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/6337413?visit_id=636867733410310722-3224351381&hl=en&rd=1/index.html">Google My Business</a>. It doesn't have a social search tool, either. Besides, posting workflow of Loomy is not user-friendly. Loomy's editor involves full display, and it hinders to add photos quickly and reference other messages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Social media scheduling tool-5: HootSuite</p>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/ddH0VU-Fm7PRrLrvbdTomW6brhbk051Oyecy9E1Y1dvOo6ARnTRDmQigmV60M-Sm1v1Dor06RL0Vg3fakZtQFCfzYngzmvFyNN-3KXRep6ExmxjFTg5SGNj8i_OFojE0-0Th8Lta" style="height:424px; width:593px"></p>
<p>HootSuite is a prominent application in social media marketing. It lets us <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/index.html">schedule content</a> to 35 various (wow!) social media channels. Additionally, it has some exciting reporting features and collaboration. For instance, we can create a content library that we can pick from at a later time or we are able to schedule content from RSS feeds automatically.</p>
<p>The menus of HootSuite are hard to navigate, and it can be confusing to onboard our new team members.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Social media scheduling tool-6: Sprout Social</h3>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/McjZ-Os6C7xr8VMU4CkdaJ6VjS_nfS48_iGXB3cO2op_t22BYO4X3e7_dPGvGGaqM6zkMsRRImtzba7BNYeXSKGPaB0jBXTheD1bO7CRTzguKSrGjBTH0urB4V6TbXBNDmNPPFH6" style="height:424px; width:593px"></p>
<p>Sprout Social is a social media scheduling tool whose goal is to provide corporate brands and large agencies. The main advantage of Sprout Social is having an excellent content calendar and an automatic social inbox feature. This inbox feature helps to adjust scheduling contents and replying clients request easily. Moreover, Sprout Social's innovative RSS feed scheduler assists us in sharing blog content quickly. It is really perfect for publication or anybody with a corporate blog.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, please take into account that Sprout Social application is too costly. Even, we can say that it is the most expensive social media scheduling tool. Sprout Social app begins at $99 per user. That's why this program is not recommended for small companies.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Social media scheduling tool-7: Sendible</h3>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/aF0AEJzzTM0M-pURrWb6KidpVPaaa60W3gmoJagA3rynPj_jz4Fge7awREZyVeT8D_VZMMky_OWfjwywKWh7pzn5kMhgaFL4G-OPL7FgrdSsfBog3XBgWK7zT7NvvZLxa-CTbcUf" style="height:424px; width:593px"></p>
<p>Sendible - this program is a social media scheduling and analytics tool. The primary target of Sendible is social media agencies. The app takes a visual approach to social media scheduling by social media calendar (like ViralTag), and in order to repost blog content, it also uses RSS feed integration. Furthermore, you can automatically respond to comments and private messages directly via intuitive social inbox.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sendible gives us a limited number of monthly reports. It is not suitable if we have more than one customer. Because you will not be able to make enough reports for each client please, keep in my if you want to purchase this tool.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Social media scheduling tool-8: Agorapulse</h3>
<p><img alt="agora-pulse" src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/j4G2K75wNcBoSgNP6aDTA5DnSauaqutqx4KBIDaspEzcZAoyKcpLCDajl2M3ZwT1IiLr48M-FGRBjgtMPJfbFuyaWTIcphGycQeyOjzdr2XUGWDgs9lwfl7fMuVqXXQNPpT9RVk0" style="height:424px; width:600px"></p>
<p>Another collaboration-focused social media scheduling tool is Agorapulse</p>
<p>We can schedule posts to main social media channels, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Google+, YouTube and call our team members to respond customer questions and to cooperate on posts. Furthermore, like many of other relevant applications, we can follow our social media development in Agorapulse. For example, we can get content reports and hashtag monitoring from the program.</p>
<p>We must underline that the pricing structure of Agorapulse can be a difficulty for purchasing it. The lowest-end price starts from $39 per month. Additionally, it includes only three social media profiles and this not low price.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Social media scheduling tool-9: EveryPost</h3>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh6.googleusercontent.com/6DyNsDR7ESTrykksFqQe-ZsJIceMbhS32ZAv5T5Fb62NXT-w_0WELA3ddNu9jXZyQRlitMnEF0ya9x8OHCCBE5UEFZ2n52x2bo3CUskbbLE0suPLpQEHxMJu1Cnp6Szl-tYd1UzC" style="height:424px; width:593px"></p>
<p>EveryPost is the last social media scheduling tool that we will talk today. This program supports just three social media channels: Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. EveryPost possesses an excellent browser extension to update your social media accounts. Also, its mobile application is user-friendly, and we can schedule in-house content from the program's dashboard.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above EveryPost supports only three social media channels, and it means the program doesn't have access to other critical social media platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn or Google My Business. Also, EveryPost doesn't possess reporting and analytics features either. Hence, it is impossible to see how our content is performing. So we will need another social media scheduling program to prove the results for customers.</p>
<p>Those social media scheduling tools will save you time and increase your productivity in 2019.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Personal branding and social media</h3>
<p><img alt="social-media-marketing" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/R4UsxO-77uObfpZLqGlv8BYfbTPlTCMUQsVNHIko6LjJ74ZzxGUtvjFlu_J3fZsCklcddNLMh-oG8BlkupbiCCLlobcKThTKEJWmjQOdSUCZDgpmrbqwg82qHTW__8d0V_0kr13Y" style="height:386px; width:602px"></p>
<p>Social media marketing is an excellent method to promote yourself and to get your activity out into the world. Social media provides our works and gain a following that will go on to benefit from our jobs. However, it can also be a trap. You must watch out every your steps - posts thought, comments if you are a famous person, or you want to be popular. It is essential to know social media tactics and how to interact with your users.</p>
<p>You can manage your social media marketing yourself or entrust it to experienced managers. So, lets begin to evaluate the leading social media platforms for <a href="../branding/index.html">personal branding</a>.</p>
<h3>Facebook</h3>
<p>Firstly, we will talk about Facebook. This social media platform is one of the biggest websites in the world. Facebook contains <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/index.html">the largest user base</a>, and it also has the most widely used for all nations. Regardless of the field, every business must exist on Facebook. Facebook provides us with three methods to promote our branding:</p>
<p>1) Using the private Facebook profile;</p>
<p>2) Creating an official page;</p>
<p>3) Creating a group.</p>
<p>Personal profile  Many politicians, writers, bloggers, and influencers use this method for social media marketing. Moreover, we see that they can succeed with a personal profile. Although, some social media experts recommend not to use a personal profile for business activities.</p>
<p>Official page  Creating Facebook page let you show up professionally in the business. Furthermore, it also helps you to have more control of the social media marketing aspect of your brand. Facebook page gets significant interaction from users. Additionally, we strongly recommend you to verify the page.</p>
<p>Facebook group  it is a more specific way to grow your personal branding. Users in the Facebook group are usually loyal to you. However, they require more attention and care. Facebook groups are the best place to discuss topics or take surveys.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p>Twitter is one of the most watched social media platforms. From presidential politics to celebrity gossip, Twitter has become a website where we can test it all. This social platform is a tremendous place to exchange concepts and get our branding out there. From a business point of view, Twitter can be a reliable tool if we use it correctly. Twitter is a fast-paced social media channel for us to pitch our personal branding.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Twitter has a limited amount of characters it, motivates the elevator pitch format. To grow personal branding on Twitter, you should build a following.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Usually, peoples on Twitter act on a follow-for-follow strategy. It means that you can find and follow those people who may be interested in your activity. However, selecting the right people to follow is not a simple process. If you are a teacher, doctor, politician or a journalist, then Twitter is an excellent place for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Instagram</h3>
<p>This social media platform is very different from Facebook or Twitter. The main focus of Instagram is on the photo and pictures. If your target group is young people and you want to increase the personal branding around them, then you must choose Instagram. As we said pictures are key detail on Instagram, so you will need a good camera. Alternatively, you can cooperate with photographers.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may need an excellent graphic designer to design your images or posters. Some people do not take Instagram seriously. However, it is the fast <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/index.html">extending social platform</a>, and Instagram can probably contribute to improving your branding. Celebrities like actors, singers, authors, and popular bloggers use Instagram for business. So, dont hesitate about participating professionally on Instagram.</p>
<p>You may pick one or more social platforms at the same time. Just take the power of social media marketing seriously. It is a beneficial way to improve your personal branding. If you dont have enough time for managing your social media channels, you can use ads on social platforms. You will pay money for it, but is there anything free in life?</p>
