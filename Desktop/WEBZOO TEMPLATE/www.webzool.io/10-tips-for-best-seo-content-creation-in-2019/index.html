<div class="all-questions">
<p>No matter in which industry you own a business, you need to promote your products and services. There are different kinds of promotion ideas you can use. The most used one nowadays is content promotion. If you want to appear on the top of Google search, you need to investigate time and money for <em>SEO content creation</em>. Google is an unofficial gateway of the internet and the best way to create brand awareness. Every day approximately 3.5 million searches happen. Considering the numbers, it becomes obvious why every marketer puts importance to search engine optimization. Thanks to continually developing search engine optimization algorithms, content marketing is evolving every day. To help you reach the top search result, we will introduce several tips.  </p>
<p>During recent years, Google has made several changes to SEO algorithms. Those changes will indeed impact old SEO techniques, yet some of them will remain unchanged. Therefore, it is difficult for people to determine which <a href="../6-essential-seo-strategies-focusing/index.html" target="_blank">SEO methodologies</a> are useful and which ones are not. You can learn more about these techniques if you continue reading the article. To get the best result from SEO content creation, you need to post items that have high ranks. You can achieve top-level by providing a high quality of content and writing. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Rankbrain</h2>
<p>There are always changes on who people find your page online. Google is continually changing algorithms and methodologies that rank web pages. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RankBrain/index.html" target="_blank">RankBrain</a> is not the new one, yet it is one of the essential changes that Google made in the past few years, which will impact your rankings. It is a machine learning system which learns how users impact your <em>SEO content creation</em> and rank it accordingly. For example, imagine you type the best remedy for allergies and click one link that you think will give you the answer. You find the article very interesting and read every single paragraph. While reading the blog, Google observes your action and give rank to that site according to your behavior. </p>
<p>On the other hand, imagine you click another result link and see that article has no relevant information and is not helpful for you. As a result, you immediately leave the page without spending so much time reading. Of course, Google notices your action and gives low ranking to that website. </p>
<p><br>
 </p>
<h2>#1 Find the right audience with targeted keywords</h2>
<p><img alt="Best SEO Content Creation" src="../media/media/ckeditor_uploads/2019/09/10/best-seo-content.jpg" style="height:563px; width:1000px"></p>
<p>Your content will not manage to reach the target audience unless you provide the right keywords in your writing. We will call the right keywords for targeted keywords during this article. But what do we mean by saying targeted keywords? There are keywords that most of your audience search, so you need to focus on these keywords. Before finding these keywords, you need to understand several concepts. Initially, you need to identify who is precisely your target audience. Then try to analyze what kind of information they need and search on the internet. And the essential part of SEO content creation is to understand is to find out what keywords your customers use to find information. These steps may seem difficult for you, yet if you try to divide it into small parts, it will be a lot easier. </p>
<p>We could call the first part of audience research. In this step, you will identify your audience and customers. Then find out which information they search online and try to prepare the <em>best SEO content </em>based on it. At the same time, creating communication can help you in the process. You can talk to them or take the survey to understand their needs. With the help of study, you could find out their demography, interests, preferences, and habits. </p>
<p>The second phase is about keyword search. You need to find keywords that relate to your business, products, or services. These keywords should be about the most commonly searched ones by your audience. The final step is the topic search. Based on the targeted keywords, you need to come up with interesting and related topics. It should be exciting and useful for your audience to read. Find out what your audience would like to learn and prepare content based on it. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>#2 Focus on the readability of your SEO content creation </h2>
<p>Finding targeted keywords and providing content, unfortunately, is not enough to get a high rank. The materials that get top grades have one essential qualification, which is readability. When your audience clicks the link to read your article, every single feature impact the audience to continue reading. When they keep reading your blog, Google gives high rank to the article as it indicates that the material is readable and engaging for the audience to understand. It suggests that the blog post is relevant to the searched keyword, and the audience finds what they want in your article. The term is dwell time and shows the time duration between the user click a link to read report and time when he/she returns to the search result page. </p>
<p>Readability of the article contributes to the dwell time and increases your ranking. To have more distinct SEO content creation, you need to provide information quickly and understandably. If your blog post is more natural and exciting to read, the more people will enter the article and stay longer, which will increase the Google ranking. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>#3 Quality matters</h2>
<p><img alt="High Quality SEO" src="../media/media/ckeditor_uploads/2019/09/10/best-seo-content-2.jpg" style="height:666px; width:1000px"></p>
<p>According to 2019 trends in <a href="../increasing-significancy-content-marketing/index.html" target="_blank">content marketing</a>, the more quality content you provide, the more ranking you will get. Providing good quality content means you need to provide more detailed information about the given topic. Google pays attention to the quality of the material. According to famous digital marketer Eric Enge, SEO content creation that provides data gains more ranking. On the other hand, writing that lack enough information about the given topic earns less ranking. He also adds that this tradition in marketing will continue to grow in the following years. As a result, finding targeted keywords and providing content will not help you in your journey. You should have a depth of knowledge about the given topic and provide exciting content for your readers. </p>
<p>But how can you improve the quality of your article? There are several ways we could mention for you. First of all, you could try to write more extended SEO content creation, which is longer than 2000 words. Secondly, you could investigate the topic from different angles and perspectives. To help you write more depth, you can benefit not only from Google search but also from scholarly articles, JSTOR library, etc. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>#4 Page speed as a crucial factor in high ranking</h2>
<p>The simple way to improve your ranking is to increase the page speed. You can try to improve the load and display speed to keep your audience read your SEO content creation. If your page loads slowly, it will make your users frustrated and make them leave the page immediately without reading the blog. Who would sit and wait for your page to load? No, one is going to lose time for your blog post as there are hundreds of Google search results that they could refer. According to statistics, the audience will wait on average three seconds for your page to load. In case it takes more than three seconds, they will immediately leave the page and continue their search on other articles. Another research reveals that users wait approximately 10 or 20 seconds until the page loads. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>#5 Pay attention to visuals</h2>
<p>Research shows that your audience enjoys reading the best SEO content with relevant pictures than reading articles that contain no pictures. It is because we respond to <a href="../seo-friendly-web-design-developments/index.html" target="_blank">SEO friendly design</a> more than writing. It grabs the attention of the user and makes him/her stay longer on your page. However, you should not provide any picture to attract the audience. The images you put on your blog should highly relate to the topic of content and should be high-quality images. You will manage to write more professional and cohesive content with the help of high-quality images. We offer you to add pictures in your content to get the better SEO. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>#6 Featured Snippets</h2>
<p><img alt="Best SEO Services in California" src="../media/media/ckeditor_uploads/2019/09/10/best-seo-content-3.jpg" style="height:668px; width:1000px"></p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9351707/index.html" target="_blank">Featured Snippets</a> could the best way to get the attention of the target audience. It is a new trend in 2019, and it seems that it will continue to grow in the following years. The block of information shows up in the search result and gives a general understanding of your SEO content creation. Whenever someone searches something on Google, he/she gets the featured snippet at the <a href="../key-steps-rise-top-search-results-google-search/index.html" target="_blank">top search result</a>, which contains the summary of the blog. Along with summary paragraph user also gets access to the article. It is a desirable place to put your items as helps you differentiate your content from others. </p>
<p>To increase your content chance to show up in featured snippet, you could use several methodologies. First of all, answer the questions in your writing. Secondly, your content should have the highest quality you can have. Moreover, bulleted and numbered lists will help you a lot to be in the featured snippets. The next methodology is to provide data and statistics from reliable sources. And finally, your content should have a clear structure that the audience could easily find needed information. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>#7 Be an expert</h2>
<p>Today, Google values expert writing and authority in the contents more than ever before. Google has recently uploaded search quality guidelines, and according to it, both a creator of content and search history of audience impact the quality of the page. To prove the reputation of content, you could provide several things in your writing. The first thing could be your expertise or writing experience. It could contain how many years you are writing content or whether you own any published books or you took a class from an experienced writer. The second way to prove the <a href="../brand-reputation-improvement-tactics-2019/index.html" target="_blank">brand reputation</a> is what other sites say about you and your articles. It can include reviews, author bios, Wikipedia articles, news, or forum discussions. Usually, real audience or experts of the SEO content creation gives reputation to your items. Note that blog posts represent actual companies and reputation results apply to both contents, and the company owns the article. </p>
<p>Each website tries to convince people that their company is the best. And there are lots of webmasters who read the regulation guidelines and write reviews about the company. Therefore, the audience needs to read reviews from reliable and independent organizations. When the website tells a positive opinion about something, yet independent source tells the opposite one, then the customer will trust the external source. Overall, in order not to face these kinds of situations, you can provide <a href="../7-reasons-about-us-page-website-essential/index.html" target="_blank">about us page</a>. Additionally, you could create a separate page for your content writers as well. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>#8 Do your research</h2>
<p><img alt="SEO Content" src="../media/media/ckeditor_uploads/2019/09/10/best-seo-content-4.jpg" style="height:563px; width:1000px"></p>
<p>Doing your research before starting to write the best SEO content is an essential part of SEO content. You should provide recent facts, statistics, reliable research results to keep your content interesting. That way, you will create thousands of opportunities for other sites to link to your writing and cite your material. According to 2018 Mantis Research, marketing research is a crucial factor to reach to the target audience. 56% of the best SEO content marketers that used reliable research in their article met their expectations. As a result, they have achieved <a href="../5-adwords-campaign-tips-bring-traffic/index.html" target="_blank">more website traffic </a>due to the provided research data. As you can see, research has a vital role in content writing, and you can also use the power of statistics to increase your ranking. We can provide some research ideas for you so that you could use them in your blog posts. </p>
<p>Original research idea could be doing a case study about your brand success. Secondly, you can quickly investigate the industry and demonstrate the result in your writing. And finally, you can make your analysis and provide it as your personal opinion. It could also be attractive to your target audience to read the writers perspective. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>#9 Power of voice search engine optimization</h2>
<p>During 2018 we have seen the power of voice search, and it is going to be essential in the next few years. Therefore, considering voice search optimization would be excellent for getting a high ranking. Today there are many other ways and devices such as Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, etc. which change the way we search for things online. Therefore, voice search is becoming a required field in the search engine area. Additionally, we have seen how Google has integrated AI into its SEO, and RankBrain now provides the most accurate search results than ever before. Voice search will make a massive shift to the voice search engine optimization. Maybe today there is not enormous traffic to the voice search, but in a short time, it will change the whole SEO structure for <a href="../digital-marketing-help-business-grow/index.html" target="_blank">digital marketing</a>. </p>
<p>As we have mentioned, voice research will take a large part of voice SEO. Therefore, you need to prepare your SEO content creation for that. If you get ready for that, you will boost your SEO and get a lot of traffic to your website. Let us give you some tips about how you can prepare your page for voice search optimization.

<h2>#10 Social media shares and link building for SEO</h2>
<p><img alt="Best SEO Content" src="../media/media/ckeditor_uploads/2019/09/10/best-seo-content-5.jpg" style="height:583px; width:1000px"></p>
<p>It is no surprise that <a href="../ultimate-guide-social-media-marketing-2019/index.html" target="_blank">social media marketing</a> has a substantial impact when it comes to ranking. Google usually gives high ranking to the websites that have lots of social media shares. It means that Google trust websites which provide the best SEO content that people share.
