                                <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) audit is a process for evaluating the search engine visibility of a website in a couple of ways. While there are different tools and techniques you can manage to audit a website, the best
                                    solution is to either perform the audit by following a guide or hire a professional SEO Auditor to perform the work for you. With the help of completed <a href="../why-seo-more-than-just-rankings/index.html">SEO audit</a>,
                                    you will manually review the website and come up with recommendations of what needs to be improved and what needs to be corrected so that the performance and visibility of the website in search engines are improved.</p>

                                <h3>HOW TO CONDUCT YOUR OWN SEO AUDIT?</h3>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>After my research on how to audit a website and test different audit tools, I came up with a guideline that covers everything you need to check.</p>
                                <p>Here are three options in case if you want to audit your web page by yourself.</p>
                                <p>Do it yourself. There are a number of resources on how to manage a Local SEO audit of your website by yourself from tips of "how to get started," to operating the worlds greatest Local SEO audit, to even "how to conduct
                                    a 45-minute Local SEO audit". You can easily find even more devices by a simple search. Although, this alternative wont cost you any money, consider that it will take a lot of time of yours if you want to do it in
                                    the right way. A full audit of a website could take your time up to 2 days, and not all of us have that kind of time.</p>
                                <p>Run some software. Another alternative is to enter your URL and Google Analytics information to a website, which will then operate the audit for you. Many of these are out of money and simple to use, but consider that it
                                    may not be as specific to your web page as if a person were to conduct it because it performs same indicators on all web pages, regardless of their purpose.</p>
                                <p>Hire a professional. Last option is to hire an expert to manage your audit. This choice will cost you, but if youre fighting to get the traffic you want, it may be worth it. Its a good option because you wont have to
                                    spend hours of your time on it, and youll get personalized suggestions for improvement.</p>
                                <p>So, let's go through step by step. To make it easier, in this guideline we will go through these steps:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>

                                    <li>
                                        <p>TECHNICAL SEO AUDIT</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>ON PAGE SEO AUDIT</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>OFF PAGE SEO AUDIT</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h2>What is Local SEO Audit?</h2>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>A Local SEO audit is an evaluation of the webpages approachability and ranking success. A Local SEO audit includes an analysis of your <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/2853879?hl=en/index.html">Google My Business locations</a>,
                                    as well as recommendations for how to improve it and raise your ranking. Local SEO Audit works a little differently than the mainstream versions. Local buyers (searchers) are often searching from an area which is close
                                    to your business, and theyre likely interested in local information like phone numbers and directions.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>Does the business have a real address in the target location?</h4>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>Real address of the business in the target location is significant due to some factors that can increase the selected goals of your business and you should check this option in your audit process.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>Why is the location of business so important? Your choice of business location directly influences your expenses and income. Even in today's world where people can buy and sell through the internet and project teams can

                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>Content care is another key factor in Local SEO audit. So what is helpful, accurate, high-quality content? To cover that question you have to understand Googles ultimate aim for search. Let's take a more in-depth look
                                    at search, how its evolving, and how that affects SEO. Then well review the difficulties you face as a content creator and what you need to do to create higher quality content on your web page. Its important to understand
                                    why Google is moving this kind of "content care." Google, the king of search engines, is a type of machine being responsible for answering people's questions and processes over three and a half billion searches per
                                    day. And since we discuss search engine optimization, they answer this question pretty well.</p>

                                <p>When Larry Page and Sergey Brin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google/index.html">co-founded Google</a> in 1998, they did so to organize the information to make it further accessible and useful. The purpose is the
                                    same even today but has changed quite a bit over the years. Googles algorithms are continually evolving to deliver, as they say, &relevant and useful results in a portion of a second. The relevant and useful results
                                    that Google is trying to deliver are the parts of the contents that are accessible throughout the web. These parts of the content are ranked by their order of relevance and usefulness to the user performing the search,
                                    which means, if you want your content to have any SEO value at all, it needs to be useful to searchers. But how you make sure your content is beneficial for searches?</p>
                                <h4>Here are some recommendations by Google you need to take into consideration in Local SEO Audit :</h4>
                                <p><em>Useful and informative:</em> If you are launching a site for a restaurant, you can insert the location, operation hours, contact info, menu, and a blog to distribute upcoming events.</p>
                                <p>More useful and valuable than other sites: if you write about some specific theme, make sure your article provides a better value or a different perspective than the numerous articles on the web on a particular theme.</p>
                                <p><em>Credible:</em> Show the credibility of your site by using original research, links, citations, testimonials, and reviews. A biography of author or testimonials from real customers can help increase your page's reputation
                                    and trustworthiness.</p>
                                <p><em>High quality:</em> Your web page's content should be specific, unique and high quality. It shouldn't be mass-produced or outsourced on a large number of other web pages. Don't forget that the primary goal of your content
                                    should be allowing visitors to have a good user experience, only then ranking in first pages in search engines should bother you.</p>
                                <p><em>Engaging:</em> Add images of products, yourself or your team and bring life and color to your site. Ensure there are no factual, stylistic and spelling errors. A large number of ads, as a rule, is also confusing for
                                    visitors to your site. Try to increase visitor engagement through comments, social media widgets, and regular updates.</p>
                                <p>When these elements are in their order, you maximize the potential of the value of SEO in your content. If you dismiss them, your content will have very little value. You have a chance to maximize the potential SEO value
                                    of your content when these elements are fulfilled. Once you miss these elements, your content will have very little value. But, creating great content isnt the only way of success. Theres also a technical side of
                                    the content you need to be aware of as well. The SEO value of content depends on how informative, useful, valuable, credible, and engaging it is.</p>
                                <p>"Optimizing content" is significant. If your content is not optimized, you won't rank in search engine optimization as effective as you aim. To create optimizing content, you should follow some instructions in order to
                                    have "Audience-Centric" content. Audience-centric is the technical stuff involving factors like keywords, meta titles, meta descriptions, and URLs and means that you are concentrating on what audiences want to see or
                                    hear rather than what you want to talk about.</p>

                                <h4>Does the location have consistent NAP-W information across all citations?</h4>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>NAP consistency is when your locations (company's) name, address, and phone number are entered the same way across the web, from your web-page to your social media profiles to directory listings. Its necessary to make
                                    sure your web address is listed consistently as well, even though NAP stands for name, address, phone number. Consistent listings cover not just the same primary information, but the same spelling and formatting, as
                                    well. SEO is all about the details! Take into consideration this fact in your Local SEO Audit.</p>
                                <p>When your company's (business, location, etc.) NAP is consistent, the related information shows up on all profiles and in all directories, which supports search engines recognize who you are, what type of business you do,
                                    and how searchers can find and reach your location.</p>
                                <p>So, lets think these three listings using the same NAP shown in the example above:</p>

                                <p>JJs HVAC</p>
                                <p>Corner of Dover St. & Main St.</p>

                                <p>Accordingly, depending on the number of social media profiles your business has, and how many directories it is listed in, its possible that your NAP seems like this. We notice it with our customers all the time. Its
                                    just not something people often consider when creating profiles or listings.</p>
                                <p>When all three of these listings are drifting around, not only can users get confused about which listing is the exact one for the service theyre seeking, but also so can SEOs. And probably you dont need to mislead the
                                    search engines.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>How NAP Consistency Impacts SEO and do I need to take care of it in Local SEO Audit check?</h4>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>Many business owners brush off the significance of consistent NAP information, considering that both users and SEO are smart enough to know that two almost similar listings, like Jake Johns Heating & Air Conditioning and
                                    JJs HVAC, are the same.</p>
                                <p>Unluckily, thats not the case.</p>
                                <p>The truth is, NAP consistency is vital for businesses aiming to improve their search rankings, increase the traffic to their web page, and get more sales from the web. When users notice your business listed under multiple
                                    names, with different addresses, or using inconsistent phone numbers, they get confused. So, they choose a company whose data is consistent because they have more trust and confidence in that style of listing. And because
                                    searchers think and act this way, search engines also think and work the same way.</p>
                                <p>If SEO is finding different information about your NAP, theyre not going to know for sure what your business is or where it's location. When the search engines find various details related to your company, they lose confidence
                                    in your listingso they are more likely to provide searchers with another listing that theyre more confident of. So, your company's NAP consistency is your first step if you aim to perform in the search results for
                                    related keywords in your service field.</p>

                                <p>You can have access to this business listing information through some of Google properties  for instance, Google Maps. For everything you want your potential buyer find and use from your services, and your products, you

                                <p><em>Create high quality, engaging images.</em> This sounds so simple, but it is something that many businesses dont consider. Yes, you want to be sure that youre adding visuals to your Google My Business in a way that
                                    you can draw in customers, but if those pictures are missing quality, it wont benefit you in the long run.</p>
                                <p>Its perfect for getting a professional camera and photographer to make your business pop. One of the best options you can do is to hire a professional photographer, who will come to your business and take professional
                                    and high-quality photos of your location. If its impossible for you to hire a photographer, the newest smartphones all have excellent camera quality, so use what you can. It's necessary to make sure that the photos
                                    are engaging, exciting and high quality by using different angles, good lighting, and well thought-out shots.</p>
                                <p>Also be sure that your visuals are uploaded in a suitable format, size, and resolution.</p>
                                <p>Format: JPG or PNG</p>
                                <p>Size: 10 KB to 5MG</p>
                                <p>Resolution: 720 x 720 pixels at least</p>
                                <p><em>Add images regularly.</em> This option is something that so many businesses survey when building their GMB listing. A lot of people believe that once you add information and photos to your listing, then you are done,
                                    which is not the truth. Google works with algorithms that they use to settle which businesses stay on top of search results, and they always support the business listings that are continually updating their GMB. It
                                    requires time, but it is crucial if you want to stay on top.</p>
                                <p>Once you add your base images, you should be adding new photos every seven days if you can. This doesnt mean an immense number of new photos every week, just one or two recent pictures of your latest products, service
                                    projects, employees or events. Think like the consumer: if youre searching for a new business online, you need to familiarize yourself as much as possible with the business, its location, and service/product. Repeatedly
                                    updating your photos is the best way to do this.</p>
                                <p><em>Optimize your image information.</em> A huge part of successful Search Engine Optimization is optimizing the information of images, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif/index.html">EXIF data</a>. To do
                                    this, you should regularly rename each image with the appropriate keywords before you upload it. You also need to add tags and descriptions to your pictures whenever possible. You also need to use an option of Geotagging
                                    all of your photos, which adds a location to your image using correct coordinates. This is essential for GMB and at the same time for Local SEO Audit since your entire listing is based on your location and Google Maps.</p>
                                <p><em>This will primarily connect your photo with your business location.</em> Your SERP position will be strengthened thanks to it. There is various software that will be helpful with this as well, including ASAP maps, where
                                    a team of specialists will do this for you! Completing by you or by the team you hired these steps shows Google that you are the one of the most appropriate business in the area and have the most reliable SEO techniques,
                                    which will give you a chance of a higher ranking than your competitors in search results by the help of Google's algorithm.</p>
                                <p><em>Avoid irrelevant photos.</em> This point is especially crucial if Google auto-generated your business listing before you claimed it by yourself. Google will pull visuals that they assume are associated with your business,
                                    and often they are not ideal. Add a lot of new, updated images to make sure that your photos are the ones that are shown first not Google's but consumers.</p>
                                <p>Also, you may have some photos with good quality a few years ago with items or services that are on the list you don't offer anymore. Even if these are beautiful photos, you want to avoid uploading them so that you dont
                                    mislead customers who may come looking for what was in that image. The same technique goes for uploading photos of an old location if you recently moved your business.</p>
                                <p>Lastly, this is mostly self-explanatory, but avoid taking photos of your building if the weather is not appropriate or upload poorly cropped images. In case youre unsure of a picture, think to yourself: Would I use this
                                    photo in an ad? You should add photos that you are proud of, and that will confidently showcase your business.</p>
                                <p>Yes, it is a fact that it is not as easy as it seems, but its worth it. If you are willing to put the time and effort into optimizing your photos on your GMB page, Google will reward you with increased search results and
                                    surely add you to the highly coveted Top 3.</p>
                                <p><em>Review images added by the Public</em>. Google has an option that customers can add photos to your business. Google does this to make sure that whoever is observing your page gets the real impression of your business,
                                    showing images from both the owner and from actual clients. This can have its drawbacks if customers upload unflattering or unrelated to your business photos. Unluckily, in case of if you don't like it, you cant just
                                    delete a customer photo. You have to report it to Google and have them approve the deletion if you want a picture to be removed. Because of this, you need to continually check the customer photos to make sure that you
                                    avoid those adverse outcomes as much as possible and quickly take care of any problems.</p>

                                <h4>Is the target keyword in the title and the first sentence?</h4>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>In keyword research, look for ways to insert your keywords compatibly in the title and description. Local SEO Audit requires being concentrated on these factors. For SEO driven blog posts, you can consider long-tail keywords,
                                    34 word keywords you want to use. If you have a solid understanding of language, you won't face trouble naturally putting these into a title.</p>
                                <p>Lets imagine you are a nutritionist and you run a blog to present your expertise. You might have used certain keyword combinations like nutritionist in Los Angeles etc. on your homepage. But, for your next post, you
                                    want to focus on offering customers fillings. So, you identify best ways of diets as a high-traffic, low-competition keyword. You might use the title How to Choose the Best Ways of Diets. Similarly, you might write
                                    in your description. &explains how to select the best ways fillings to make your right choice&</p>
                                <p>The point is, you want to use the keyword in a way that you use in normal conversation. One of the big issues that people ran into years ago with SEO is that they looked to put in unrelated keywords. I remember when I was
                                    first learning SEO, doing work for a medium-sized firm, I had a real problem with it. They would ask for the most unnatural keywords, and I could hardly fit them in using proper English. Fortunately, this has changed
                                    and now natural is the key to success.</p>
                                <p>So, whether its a single word or a long-tail keyword, make sure it makes sense when you say it.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>Does the local target page have an embedded map?</h4>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>We know how vital showing up in search results is for your business and when someone Googles you, your business, or your services, products you want to be found by them. We are also aware of how showing up in local search
                                    results can drive local customers to your business, website, product and your location. That is the reason why you should fulfill this option in your audit process. In the case, if someone is searching for your services
                                    or products of your business in your area, you want to show up the local results that appear highlighted on the map on the top of the SEO results page. If done well, you can show up on the map and the organic listings
                                    below it!</p>
                                <p><img alt="google-maps-location" src="../../lh4.googleusercontent.com/ak9QfyrNFSXywu-eP57PgpWpkVeFkiBrndkbJ5CuLQBIYrsB7IerGBhWNF3cTXcYUJ03CA7zs1BwNUXHojha2hmBLvWokXp64KG80XgKm8XC4M9nOyPyWSrX0P33k-thT9pG477CWtpBoFeJAw" style="height:415px; width:624px"></p>
                                <p>We all believe people are looking primarily for us by name, but more often, they are looking for our services in their area. They might use a general term, like dentist and not a business name, like Jake's Dentist Centre.</p>
                                <p>This is the point why local search performs an immense role. At this point, a lot of businesses start claiming their GMB account, Instagram, FB page and address, etc. This is all very necessary, but we keep seeing businesses
                                    overlook the updates they should make to their site to be ready for local searches.</p>
                                <p>Here are three places on your web age you should update to claim high rank for local search:</p>
                                <p>Make sure that you added a Google Map to Your Contact page  Almost every webpage has a contact page. Google likes the situation when the contact page has a google map embedded on the page. ï¿½Attaching an interactive map
                                    for people looking for your location is super helpful to the searcher and very simple to do. Prefer the google map that points to your Google My Business listing, and you can customize the look and feel of that map.
                                    Once you have the map the exact way you want it to appear, one thing you need to do is to copy the embed code and drop it into your site.</p>
                                <p>Add your location to your page title  Your website's page title is in the code of your site and says what this content is about. It also shows up in search results. Most local searches have thing/need, location so you
                                    should have your page title set up the same way.</p>
                                <p>Be aware of your meta descriptions  Your meta description is a snippet of code that shortens your pages content. Not only does this help SEOs, but it also shows up in the search results pages, too. This is an appropriate
                                    place to add your location or contact number. Someone could get all the information they need before even clicking through to your webpage. To optimize your business to be found in local search, you need to update you
                                    <a href="../glossary/nap-name-address-phone/index.html">NAP meaning name, address, and phone</a>, listings on local sites and directories, but dont forget to update your website too!</p>

                                <h2>What is a Technical SEO Audit?</h2>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>

                                <p>The auditing process is the best way of anticipation which you can count the increase and create opportunities. The main thing that you must take into account is to find all the technical problems about contacting with
                                    search engines. It means that you should determine hinders if your search results are not good. Everyone wants to know the situation of his (her) site. Thus, the Technical SEO Audit is necessary.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>

                                <p>In order to launch the Technical SEO Audit, you need to adjust the points for your website. We have collected 17 of them in this article, but if you have other criteria which you suppose that are vital, you can add them.
                                    As this part of SEO Audit is technical then we will go through it technically by answering a detailed question. ï¿½Now, we are ready to start our audit checklist.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h3>Indexing</h3>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>How many indexed pages do you have by Google? How many pages are examined by the crawler (for example, Deepcrawl)?</p>
                                <p>It is necessary to compare indexed pages and examined pages by Deepcrawl. You can search for site:example.com and see the numbers. This action helps you to come up with none indexed pages, to find out the reasons. Maybe
                                    you have some indexed pages, which you cant get them via the website.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>Does the main page appear in the first line while searching in search engines?</h4>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>Make sure your website is on the first page of search engines. You can obtain your website in search engines by applying the brand name. If it is not visible on the first page, then your site has probably had problems with
                                    updating of algorithms.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>Does the website have refused index?</h4>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>You should compare decreased organic traffic in <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/?authuser=0#/provision/index.html">Google analytics</a> and the number of pages in the Google index. Firstly,
                                    it is better to find out organic traffic results, and then you can check the status of Google index. If there is a difference, you may have some refused index. So you ought to pinpoint these pages and take into account
                                    for the crawl budget.<br> ï¿½
                                </p>
                                <h4>Crawling pages in the Deepcrawl. Are there many of them that cant be crawl?</h4>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>It would help if you organized the control of crawling. By this way, you can control it through the Deepcrawl. Sometimes there would be a problem with the server. So, please check it too.<br>
                                    <br> It is essential to be sure if there any copies of your website.</p>
                                <p>For this, You may apply some actions. For instance, take various contents from your website and search for it in a search engine. Moreover, you can use mirror site checker tools for it. You have to be aware that, 100% of
                                    similarity triggers mirror site problem. Additionally, it causes an external duplicate.</p>
                                <p>If you created reflected site to balance server loads, they must be no index. What does it mean?<br> If you carry out all changes firstly, in the tested website, then the no index control is an obligation. Make sure that
                                    there is "no index" tag in pages of the reflected site. If there is not any "no index" tag, it will be indexed in the reflected site, and it will cause extra problems.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>Usage of sitemap or max index.</h4>
                                <p>You have to create an XML folder which encompasses indexed pages (you are planning to index them). You can make it manually or with the assistance of some tools. It is critical because this file estimates your content.<br>                                    ï¿½
                                </p>
                                <h4>Is the XML structure of sitemap relevant to basic standards of protocol?</h4>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>What does it mean? The XML format is an ideal structure for sitemaps. Google supports a basic sitemap protocol, and it must be related to http://www.sitemaps.org/ protocol.</p>
                                <p>Can you update the sitemaps from an automatic server or via static forming? It will help if you have controlled that the sitemaps are in dynamic structure or a static one. It is an easy action. When you change something
                                    on your webpage, if it also changes in the sitemap, it is a dynamic structure. However, it doesn't turn then it is a static one. The sitemaps in dynamic structure always update themselves, no need to manual intervention.<br>                                    ï¿½
                                </p>
                                <h4>Did you add the sitemap to Robots.txt file?</h4>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>The current sitemap also has to be added to Robots.txt file. You also need to update the webpage after adding the sitemap to Robots.txt file. It makes easy bots to communicate with the sitemaps.</p>
                                <p>Transmit the sitemap via Search Console. It is an obligation to transmit the sitemap via Search Console. The instruction is scan by Search Console > loading via Sitemaps. In this way, you will provide Google with your sitemaps,
                                    in the case if you have mistakes, Google will inform you.</p>
                                <p>Creating maps for different types of the sitemap (for example, web, mobile, image, video, news)</p>
                                <p>It will help you if you present different sitemaps for mobile, image, video and news. The better method for it to benefit from the tools or you can do it manually. If you have a massive website, you should create different
                                    sitemaps for image and videos. ï¿½Especially, do it if you possess news records. We also emphasize it for mobile websites.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>Do your sitemaps have links more than 50,000? Do their not squeezed type more than 50 MB?</h4>
                                <p>Check the number of links and the squeezed types of the sitemaps. Scan the sitemap and download them, then you can check them by the tools. Consider that there must be maximum 50,000 links in the sitemaps, and the limit
                                    for the squeezed form is 50 MB.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>Did you realize different sitemaps for each classification and categories?</h4>
                                <p>Check the different sitemaps. Firstly, you can pinpoint a strategy for sitemaps. For the best result, you should realize separated sitemaps in the big websites.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>Is there any distinguished reduce in Search Console's crawl statistic?</h4>
                                <p>Please, take into consideration the crawl statistics of Search Console. You can implement it with the Search Console Scan > Scan Statistics. There may be some shortages as reducing of indexed pages. Always take it to control.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>Did you see the indexed URL in Search Console's URL parameter tab?</h4>
                                <p>Check the index problem for URL parameters. You can check it via the Search Console Scan > URL Parameters tab. We do not recommend to index the URL parameter. That's why it is better to choose canonical implementation.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>Are there any problems in Robots.txt files?</h4>
                                <p>Please, check the robots.txt files. You can check it via Search Console. Sometimes we see that Robots.txt file does not work correctly.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>Are there any blocked pages in Robots.txt which are not valid?</h4>
                                <p>You can block the pages which you don't want to be indexed in Robots.txt. Please, make a list about the blocked pages in Robots.txt and control it. You can use the crawl budget effectively in this way. Furthermore, you
                                    can avoid the trash index.</p>

                                    image files can drastically slow your website down.</p>

                                <p>Websites load time</p>
                                <p>To determine organic rankings, Google favors websites with quick loading times. Load speed of your website can ascertain if users stay on or skip it away. Fortunately, Google provides us with <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/index.html">a free tool to check website's load speed</a>.
                                    Any website that takes time longer than 3 seconds needs improvement in this issue.</p>

                                <h2>What is Off-Page SEO Audit?</h2>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>Off-Page SEO is a compilation of methods and techniques you can use to promote your website on the web. It is also known as link building. Off-page SEO refers to activities you can operate outside the boundaries of your
                                    website. SEOs have been trying for decades to come up with the best results for the searcher. On-site, off-page SEO and some other quality factors are the indicators of useful results.</p>
                                <p>The most important are:</p>
                                <p>Link building</p>
                                <p>Social Media Marketing</p>
                                <p>Social bookmarking</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>A useful and high-quality site is more likely to have references from other websites. It is more likely mentions on social media and more likely to be shared and bookmarked among communities.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h4>Benefits of Off-Page SEO Audit</h4>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>A strong off-site SEO strategy will generate the following advantages:</p>
                                <p>Increase in rankings: The website's rank rate will increase in the SERPs which means more traffic.</p>
                                <p>Increase in PageRank:ï¿½Page rank - it is a figure between 0 and 10. It indicates the quality and importance of a website in Google's priority. This system was invented by Google Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and it
                                    is one of the key reasons that Google was so successful in performing the most relevant results to the searcher. Today page rank is only one out of 250 factors that Google is using in the ranking of websites.</p>
                                <p>More exposure: Higher rankings also mean higher exposure. When a website ranks in the top: it gets more visits, more links, and more social media mentions. It is like a never-ending sequence of events where one thing leads
                                    to another and then to another etc.</p>

                                <h3>Link building</h3>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p><img src="../../lh3.googleusercontent.com/KCWk9fpGDrv4Do3WvxA-ynEWLRqyn7dEurmGaoiniwFlKg1aPCMX4fu_Cj0BuwPqC1dDGiWPlgq2fjPVLHEttMtRxdbnasUk19Rkf5CTPOn0jUnJVGWr0Pj_H3mwK7zI6xZBBT6RcDBRbfue-g" style="height:326px; width:624px"></p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p><a href="../6-backlink-building-mistakes-you-need-avoid/index.html">Link building </a>is the most common and effective off-Page SEO method. ï¿½Basically, by inserting external links to your website, you are gathering as many
                                    votes as you can, so that you can detour your competitors and rank higher. For example, if someone likes your article and references it from his/her blog or website, then this is like informing search engines that
                                    this page has useful and good information. Webmasters have been trying to direct links to their websites over the years to get a higher ranking, and they invented different ways to increase link count.</p>
                                <p>The most popular tips are blog directories, forum signatures, comment links, article directories, shared content directories, link exchange schemes, etc. All these methods do not work today, and you should not even try
                                    them. If you attempt to trick SEOs by building artificial links, you are more likely to get a penalty rather than a boost in rankings.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <p>So, if the above links are useless, what is a good link and how to get these links?</p>
                                <p>First, consider that the <a href="../ultimate-backlink-building-strategies-2019/index.html">strategy of link building</a> is not only a matter of quantity, but it is a matter of quality as well. It no longer matters how
                                    many links are pointing to your website, but it is more important the source of these links. As an example, think of a link from a typical blog. It doesn't have the same weight as a link from Wikipedia or a link from
                                    a blog of some famous person is not the same as a link from my blog.</p>
                                <p>Natural linkingï¿½are links that pointing to your website has to be natural links. These links are exactly what their name implies. If a blogger or website owner likes some website or blog, then he/she needs naturally add
                                    a link to his/her blog. This is a natural link building; when a link has more value from the readers eyes rather than the search engines eyes.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h3>Social Media Marketing</h3>
                                <p><a href="../social-media-marketing-2019/index.html">Social Media marketing</a> is also one of the most critical parts of off-page SEO and a form of link building at the same time. Almost all of the links from social media
                                    sites define as no follow But in fact, they surely have value. Social Media mentions are valuable as ranking factors, and appropriate form of social media profiles can also increase SEO.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
                                <h3>Social bookmarking</h3>
                                <p>Nowadays social bookmarking is not as popular as it used to be in the past, but it is still a way to get traffic to a website. Depending on your niche you can easily find websites like scoop.it or reddit.com to promote
                                    your content.</p>
                                <p>ï¿½</p>
