<article>
<div class="all-questions">
<p>Website conversion optimization goes hand in hand with a companys revenue growth. If you want to make your business profitable, you should be concerned about visitors performing specific actions such as making a purchase, filling out a form or subscribing. We are going to talk about the factors that have a significant influence on these actions and lead to <a href="../../webzool.io/landing-page-guidelines/index.html">website conversion optimization</a> rate increase.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways of how your website can help your business grow. Especially small companies need a site to attract loyal customers. <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/learn/local-consumer-review-survey/index.html">According to the survey</a>, 86 percent of users have told that they have used the Internet to find a local business. But two years ago 78 percent of people were using the Internet to find a local company.</p>
<p>†</p>
<h3>What is the Website Conversion Optimization Rate?</h3>
<p>The website conversion optimization rate is the percentage of visitors to a website that accomplished the desired goal out of the total number of visitors. For instance, if your landing page gets 100 visitors per month and 20 of visitors complete the desired actions, the conversion rate will be 20 divided by 100, or 20 percent.</p>
<p>In general, there are two kinds of conversion. They are micro and macro. <a href="https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Macro_Conversion/index.html">Macro conversion</a> is about visitors actions that are determined at completing activities that are the most essential for revenue of a business such as making a payment, filling the contact us form out or signing up for a free trial. Micro conversion is about actions that do not have a direct influence on revenue growth, but it can have precedence over macro conversions. Free ebook downloads, case study views, social media follows, or blog subscriptions can be examples of micro-conversion. Depending on the business goal, you can take into consideration micro and macro website conversion optimization that can bring the best of the best results.</p>
<p>Now we can look closer at components of any website conversion optimization rate technique.</p>
<h3>Offer</h3>
<p>†</p>
<p>Do you think that your proposal is attractive? This is the fundamental question you have to answer. If the proposal that your company makes is not worthwhile to your visitors, all the <a href="../../webzool.io/digital-marketing/index.html">digital marketing</a> and design efforts made towards website conversion optimization rate will be fruitless.</p>
<p>Nowadays, when the market is packaged with goods and services, it is difficult to offer something original and extraordinary. Thats why you ought to think about what can make your offer special. From the beginning, you should list the benefits that your customers will get from your product or service and characterize the advantages that differentiate your business from the competitors. In other words, you should improve your value proposition.</p>
<p>Would you like to make your value proposition engaging and competitive? So, you should make it obvious. You can ask someone to check your landing page to see if it converts. If the people are not able to describe you in a few words, you need to notify what you offer and what they will get from your offer after checking the landing page. After that, you can revise your webpage.</p>
<p>You should make sure your value proposition talks about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>what your product or service does;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who potential customers are;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what value can bring;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what makes your offer different.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><br>
Relevant traffic</h3>
<p>†</p>
<p>Which one is better? Getting more traffic in expectation of more leads or increasing the website conversion optimization rate with the current traffic? Fundamentally, the answer depends on where you get the most for your money.</p>
<p>The first step you should follow is to check the quality of the<a href="../../webzool.io/get-juicy-SEO-traffic-gaming-site/index.html"> traffic your website </a>receives. If the traffic is targeted, but conversion rate leaves much to be desired, then you should focus on website conversion optimization. If your conversion rate is higher, you can not do any changes that can develop right now, and you can review your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-click/index.html">pay-per-click campaigns</a> to drive more traffic.</p>
<p>You have a high potential to convert visitors into leads or clients if these visitors are interested in your product and service. If you waste your <a href="../social-media-pricing-social-media-market/index.html">marketing budget</a> on fake or inconsequent traffic, it will only result in a high bounce rate. In general, you have always to check the traffic quality and suitability.</p>
<h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
<p>Without a shadow of a doubt, design decides if a landing page will convert or not. When the designer works on UI and UX, they should think about usability, user engagement, and key performance indicators.</p>
<h3>Balance business and user goals</h3>
<p>†</p>
<p>Just imagine someone comes to your website for the first time. They would like to browse the blog and About us section quickly. But after a few seconds of scrolling, a big pop-up with an exciting offer appears on the device screen. The visitor wants to close the offer, but three more pop-ups come in sight on the screen one after another asking the visitor to have a subscription for your newsletter and try your free trial. It will result in poor user experience. In this point, the business aim is to get a lead, and the visitor aim is to learn about the company more and as soon as possible. Designers should take into consideration user goals and balance positive UX with website conversion optimization techniques.</p>
<p>†</p>
<h3>Call to Action</h3>
<p>†</p>
<p>If you get your visitors complete the desired operations, tell them to do so. You should be sure that you know how to say to them.</p>
<p>Online extra information does not leave a chance to browse web pages entirely. Visitors only scan pages to take heed of key elements. Thats why marketers and designers understand how essential the call is to action psychology when it comes to attracting peoples attention.</p>
<p>Call to action might be text, button, image, animation, video, etc. It also gets visitors to perform different operations depending on business nature.</p>
<p>You have to make the call to action user-friendly to convert. You should avoid offensive techniques that can disappoint your visitors even before visitors try your product or service.</p>
<p>You should understand your audience clearly to use color psychology intelligently. Regarding gender, age, professional status, people are more likely to comprehend colors differently. Something that works well with one group of people can fail to work with another. On the other hand, if you want to make the entire page aesthetically nice, the design of call to action elements should reflect the general<a href="../../webzool.io/web-design/index.html"> web design</a>.</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>†</p>
<p>If you have paid attention to a friendly design and compelling call to action, you can begin to think about copy that will help you in conversion rate optimization.</p>
<p>You should start your content strategy by identifying your target audience. Understanding your readers will help you to reveal quickly what areas they are interested in.</p>
<p>If you want to sell sports products, you should tell stories about outdoor activities, healthy tips, share how-tos, and publish interviews with specialist sports instructors and influencers. If you manage a design service, you should talk about strategies about design.</p>
<p>Share precious information that your possible customers will search. That is the way you are going to show your expertise and willingness to help. That is the way you are going to build trust.</p>
<h3>Trust</h3>
<p>Trust on the <a href="../brand-reputation-improvement-tactics-2019/index.html">brand reputation</a> is something special that you are not able to code, design or embed into your webpage. Establishing trust around your brand and company is a precise part of website conversion optimization rate. It demands time and consistency.</p>
<p>You should be sure that you have an About us section that includes brief information about what your brand stands for and how the brand was established. You should introduce your team to your visitors and show potential customers who stand behind the brand.</p>
