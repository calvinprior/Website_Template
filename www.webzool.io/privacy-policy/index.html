<h3 class="privacy-secondary-title">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require
commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
policy. The law‚Äôs reach stretches well beyond California to
require any person or company in the United States (and
conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its
website stating exactly the information being collected and
those individuals or companies with whom it is being
shared. ‚Äì See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-
online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.
0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
<h3 class="privacy-secondary-title">According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h3>
<p>Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it
on our homepage or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‚ÄòPrivacy‚Äô and can
easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
<h3 class="privacy-secondary-title">You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>‚Ä¢ Via Email
Can change your personal information:</li>
<li>‚Ä¢ By logging in to your account</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="privacy-secondary-title">Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h3>
<p>It‚Äôs also important to note that we do not allow third-party
behavioral tracking</p>
<h3 class="privacy-secondary-title">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information
from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children‚Äôs
Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in
control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States‚Äô
consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule,
which spells out what operators of websites and online
services must do to protect children‚Äôs privacy and safety
online.</p>
<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of
13 years old.
Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins,
collect PII from children under 13?</p>
<h3 class="privacy-secondary-title">Fair Information Practices</h3>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the
backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
concepts they include have played a significant role in the
development of data protection laws around the globe.
Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and
how they should be implemented is critical to comply with
the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
<h3 class="privacy-secondary-title">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices
we will take the following responsive action, should a
data breach occur:</h3>
<p>We will notify you via email Within 1 business day</p>
<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which
requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue
enforceable rights against data collectors and processors
who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not
only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-
compliance by data processors.</p>
<h3 class="privacy-secondary-title">CAN SPAM Act</h3>
<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for
commercial email, establishes requirements for
commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have
emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out
tough penalties for violations.</p>
<h3 class="privacy-secondary-title">We collect your email address in order to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>‚Ä¢ Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
<li>‚Ä¢ Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to
our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="privacy-secondary-title">To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</h3>
<ul>
<li>‚Ä¢ Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
<li>‚Ä¢ Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
<li>‚Ä¢ Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
<li>‚Ä¢ Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
<li>‚Ä¢ Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the
bottom of each email.</li>
</ul>
